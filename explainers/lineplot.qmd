You can use the `curve` function to plot a line graph of a function. If that function were $f(x) = x^2$ for example, you would type this:

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
curve(x^2, from = -5, to = 5, n = 500, col = "red", ylab = "f(x)")
```

This function takes many arguments. 

- the first argument is a formula for the function you want to graph. The `curve` command implicitly assumes that `x` is the argument, and everything else is constant;
- `from` and `to` give the bounds of the $x$-axis;
- This command is basically evaluating the function at many points and connecting the dots. `n` specifies how many dots. Too few, and the picture would look all cattywampus:

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
curve(x^2, from = -5, to = 5, n = 5)
```

If you want multiple lines on one graph, you can call `curve` multiple times, and include the `add` argument in all but the first call:

```{r}
#| code-overflow: scroll
#| fig-align: center
curve(1*x^2, from = -5, to = 5, n = 500, col = "red", ylab = "")
curve(2*x^2, from = -5, to = 5, n = 500, col = "blue", ylab = "", add = TRUE)
curve(3*x^2, from = -5, to = 5, n = 500, col = "darkgreen", ylab = "", add = TRUE)
legend("bottomleft", c("a = 1", "a = 2", "a = 3"), 
       col = c("red", "blue", "darkgreen"), lty = 1, bty = "n")
```
