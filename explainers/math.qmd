Using `R` for the calculator is like buying a plane ticket to get free peanuts. But I have done my taxes in `R`, so...

```{r}
2 + 2 # addition
5 - 2 # subtraction
0.5 * 6 # multiplication
3 / 4 # division
sqrt(2) # square root
4 ^ 2 # exponent
exp(4.9) # base-e exponent
log(7) # natural log
abs(-6) # absolute value
ceiling(4.6) # round up
floor(4.6) # round down
factorial(4) # n! = n x (n-1) x ... x 2 x 1
choose(8, 3) # binomial coefficient (we'll get there)
```
