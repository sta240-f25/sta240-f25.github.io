Consider two vectors of the same length:

```{r}
x <- c(0.3, 0.57, -0.11, -0.26, -0.77, pi, 4, 1, 1, 5)
y <- c(9, 4, 1, 8, 4, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0)
```

If you want to create a scatter plot of the (x, y) pairs, you can use the `plot` command:

```{r}
plot(x, y, pch = 19)
```

If you wanted, for example, to plot the PMF of the binomial distribution, then your x vector has every value in the range, and your y vector has all of the individual probabilities:

```{r}
n <- 20
p <- 0.5
x <- 0:n
pmf <- dbinom(x, n, p)
plot(x, pmf, pch = 19)
```

Notice that we made use of the fact that the `dbinom` command is [*vectorized*](https://sta240-f25.github.io/explainers/vectorization.html) in its first argument; if you give it a vector with multiple values, it returns a vector with the probabilities for each one.
