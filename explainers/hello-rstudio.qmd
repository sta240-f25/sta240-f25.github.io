`R` is a programming language, like `Python`, `C++`, `Java`, `Julia`, etc. `RStudio` is an IDE (integrated development environment) that allows you to interacts with `R` in a convenient way. So if `R` is the engine, `RStudio` is the dashboard.

When you launch `RStudio`, you see something like this:

There are four panes: 

-   (bottom left) this is **the console**. It's a command line where you can type input and get output. At the very least, you can use `R` as an [overgrown calculator](https://sta240-f25.github.io/explainers/math.html);
-   (top left) this is **the editor**. If you are writing a bunch of code you want to save for later (like on your labs), you can edit the text file here;
-   (top right) this is **the environment**. It's a list of all the data and variables you have loaded;
-   (bottom right) this panel is multipurpose. Depending on the tab you select, it can display the file directory, the plot you created, the documentation, or your rendered pdf.
