title: "Summary statistics"

If you have a vector of numbers in `R`, there are many basic commands you can use to compute *summary statistics*. To illustrate, here is a vector of random numbers:

```{r}
set.seed(20)
x <- rnorm(100)
```

Of course, these commands are useful no matter where the numbers came from:

```{r}
sum(x) # the total of the numbers
mean(x) # the average of the numbers
var(x) # the variance
sd(x) # the standard deviation
median(x) # the median
max(x) # the biggest number
min(x) # the smallest number
```
