## Problem Set 0...wtf?

::: incremental
- Low stakes: worth fewer points than other problem sets;

    - (but it will be graded quite rigorously);

- It's about an 8/10 on the math difficulty scale in this class;
- You will not see much calculus in Weeks 1 - 6 and Midterm 1;

    - (mainly infinite series);

- Serious calculus begins Week 7 and looms large until the end;

    - (be prepared to do some math on Midterm 2 and the Final).

## Bottom line

You have until Week 7 to work the kinks out. If, by that time, you are confident that you understand what's happening on Problem Set 0, then you are ready.
:::

## [Problem Set 1](https://sta240-f25.github.io/problems/pset-1.html)

::: incremental
- Problems 1 - 3 currently accessible to you;
- Problems 4 - 8 accessible after today's class;
- Problems 9 - 10 accessible after next week's classes.
:::

## Problem Sets 1 - 4

Each has 10 problems following a "1 + 2 + 5 + 2" structure:

. . .

::: incremental
- 1 problem is chatty and conceptual (no math);
- 2 problems practice stuff from 2 weeks ago;
- 5 problems practice stuff from last week;
- 2 problems practice stuff from this week.
:::

. . .

So, I lecture on new stuff MoWe, and you have to do two practice problems by that same Friday.

## Set operations

| Set | Picture | Logic |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| $A\cup B$             | ![](images/union.png){width="60%"} | (inclusive) OR |
| $A\cap B$             | ![](images/intersection.png){width="70%"} | AND |
| $A^c$                 | ![](images/complement.png){width="60%"} | NOT |

## Algebraic properties {.medium}

$$
\begin{matrix}
    \text{Commutative} & A\cup B=B\cup A\\
    & A\cap B=B\cap A\\
    &\\
    \text{Associative} & (A\cup B)\cup C = A\cup (B\cup C)\\
    & (A\cap B)\cap C = A\cap (B\cap C)\\
    &\\
    \text{Distributive} & (A\cup B)\cap C = (A\cap C)\cup (B\cap C)\\
    &(A\cap B)\cup C = (A\cup C)\cap (B\cup C)\\
    &\\
    \text{De Morgan's Laws} & (A\cup B)^c=A^c\cap B^c\\ 
    & (A\cap B)^c=A^c\cup B^c.
\end{matrix}

# Translating set theory to probability

## Sample spaces

## Events

## Running example: where will the meteor land? {.small .scrollable}

The sample space is the set of all (long, lat) coordinates in this spatial region:

## "AND" events

## "NOT" events

## Implication

## Mutually exclusive events


## Summary

| **Probability**                | **Set theory**        |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------|
| $A$ or $B$ occur               | $A\cup B$             |
| $A$ and $B$ occur              | $A\cap B$             |
| $A$ does not occur             | $A^c$                 |
| $A$ implies $B$                | $A\subseteq B$        |
| $A$ and $B$ mutually exclusive | $A\cap B=\varnothing$ |
