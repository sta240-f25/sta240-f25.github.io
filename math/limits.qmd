The limit of a function $f(x)$ at a point $c$ is the value that the function approaches as $x$ approaches $c$. We denote this:

$$
\lim_{x\to c}f(x).
$$

If the limit of the function and the actual *value* of the function agree, then the function is **continuous**:

$$
\lim_{x\to c}f(x)=f(c)
$$
If a function is continuous, that makes it especially convenient to evaluate limits because it means you can just plug-in and evaluate the darn function. But as @fig-continuity illustrates, not all functions are continuous. Some functions have breaks and jumps and holes that make them **discontinuous**.

But not all discontinuities are created equal:

- (upper right) the function has a *hole*. The limit the function approaches (the hole), and the value of the function (the point) are different;
- (lower right) this function is **left continuous**. The value of the function and the limit *as you approach from the left* are in agreement. But there's a jump, and the limit *as you approach from the right* is different;
- (lower left) this function is **right continuous**. The value of the function and the limit *as you approach from the right* are in agreement. But there's a jump, and the limit *as you approach from the left* is different;
- (upper left) this function is just straight-up continuous. The left and the right limits both agree with the function value.




## Limit rules

Assume $\lim_{x\to c}f(x)$ and $\lim_{x\to c}g(x)$ exist, let $a,\,b\in\mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary constants, and let $r>0$. Then:

| rule | formula |
|------|------|
| scaling | $$\lim_{x\to c}[a\cdot f(x)]=a\lim_{x\to c}f(x)$$ |
| sum/difference | $$\lim_{x\to c}[f(x)\pm g(x)]=\lim_{x\to c}f(x)\pm\lim_{x\to c}g(x)$$ |
| linearity | $$\lim_{x\to c}[a\cdot f(x)\pm b\cdot g(x)]=a\lim_{x\to c}f(x)\pm b\lim_{x\to c}g(x)$$ |
| product | $$\lim_{x\to c}f(x)g(x)=\left[\lim_{x\to c}f(x)\right]\left[\lim_{x\to c}g(x)\right]$$ |
| quotient | $$\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\frac{\lim_{x\to c} f(x)}{\lim_{x\to c} g(x)},\quad \text{if }\lim_{x\to c} g(x)\neq0.$$ |
| power | $$\lim_{x\to c}f(x)^r=\left[\lim_{x\to c}f(x)\right]^r$$ |

## Indeterminate forms and L'H么pital's rule

Most of the time, we hope that we can appeal to continuity and evaluate limits by simply "plugging-in." But sometimes plugging in gives loony stuff:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin x}{x}=1, &\text{ but }\frac{\sin(0)}{0}=\frac{0}{0};\\
\lim_{x\to \infty}\frac{\ln x}{x}=0, &\text{ but }\frac{\ln\infty}{\infty}=\frac{\infty}{\infty}.\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Things like $0/0$, $\infty/\infty$, and $0\times\infty$ are examples of **indeterminate forms**. If you get one, it doesn't necessarily mean that [the limit does not exist](https://youtu.be/oDAKKQuBtDo?si=K_FrQDi0n2cnxDXr). It just means that the jury is still out; it's *indeterminate*. To continue investigating, you can use a tool called **L'H么pital's rule**. Whenever $\lim_{x\to c}f(x)=\lim_{x\to c}g(x)=0$ or $\pm\infty$, the rule says that

$$
\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}.
$$
The hope is that the new function $f'(x)/g'(x)$ will be well-behaved at $c$, meaning you can simplify by just plugging in. However, after applying L'H么pital's rule once and *trying* to plug-in, you may still get an indeterminate form. In that case, you'll have to take another round of derivatives, and maybe another after that, until the clouds finally part and the [sun shines upon you](https://youtu.be/SSBWiFGzsyU?si=GKmf7QAhjyvAAK0d).

## Example: multiple rounds of L'H么pital's

Consider:

$$
\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{(\ln x)^2}{x}.
$$

$\lim_{x\to\infty}(\ln x)^2=\infty$ and $\lim_{x\to\infty}x=\infty$, so let's take some derivatives:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x}(\ln x)^2&=\frac{2\ln x}{x}\\
\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x}x&=1.
\end{aligned}
$$
The ratio of derivatives is thus $2(\ln x)/x$, but this still gives an indeterminate form because $\lim_{x\to\infty}2\ln x=\infty$ and $\lim_{x\to\infty}x=\infty$, so we have to go again:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x}2\ln x&=\frac{2}{x}\\
\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x}x&=1.
\end{aligned}
$$
The ratio of these derivatives is just $2/x$, and that goes to 0 as $x\to \infty$. In sum,

$$
\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{(\ln x)^2}{x}
\overset{\text{L'H}}{=}
\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{2\ln x}{x}
\overset{\text{L'H}}{=}
\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{2}{x}
=
0.
$$
