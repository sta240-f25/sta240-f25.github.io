## Exponent rules

Let $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ be arbitrary real numbers, and let $n$ be a positive integer:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a^0&=1\\
a^1&=a\\
a^ca^d&=a^{c+d}\\
\frac{a^c}{a^d}&=a^{c - d}\\
a^{-c}&=\frac{1}{a^c}\\
(a^c)^d&=a^{cd}\\
(ab)^c&=a^cb^c\\
\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^c&=\frac{a^c}{b^c}\\
a^{1/n}&=\sqrt[n]{a}.
\end{aligned}
$$

A particularly important function for us is the **exponential function** $e^x$, where $e\approx 2.71828$ is **Euler's number**. Because it is defined as an exponent, the exponential function obeys all the rules above: $e^xe^y=e^{x+y}$, $e^0=1$, etc.

Here's the graph of the function:

```{r}
#| label: exp
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-asp: 0.75
par(mar = c(4, 4, 4, 0.5))
curve(exp(x), 
      from = -3, 
      to = 3, 
      n = 500, 
      col = "red", 
      lwd = 2,
      yaxt = "n", 
      yaxs = "i",
      bty = "n",
      ylab = expression(e^x),
      main = "Graph of the exponential function",
      ylim = c(0, 20))
axis(2, pos = 0)
```

A few things to notice:

- the exponential is *strictly increasing* (never plateaus or goes down);
- it increases *very* quickly;
- it is defined for all real numbers $x$;
- it is strictly positive: $e^x>0$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$.

## Alternative notation
Sometimes we will write $\exp(x)$ instead of $e^x$, but they mean the same thing. We do this to make complicated expressions like this a little easier to read:
$$
e^{-\frac{1}{2}\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{\sigma^2}}=\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{\sigma^2}\right).
$$

## Logarithm rules

The **natural logarithm** function $\ln(x)$ is the *inverse* of the exponential function $e^x$. So when we write $\ln(4)$, we're asking "$e$ raised to what power is equal to 4?" Turns out it's $\ln(4)\approx 1.386$, so $e^{1.386}\approx 4$. 

Here's the graph of the function:

```{r}
#| label: log
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-asp: 0.5
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, 0.5))
curve(log(x), 
      from = 0, 
      to = 8, 
      n = 500, 
      col = "red", 
      lwd = 2,
      xaxt = "n", 
      xaxs = "i",
      bty = "n",
      ylab = "ln(x)",
      main = "Graph of the natural logarithm")
axis(1, pos = 0)
```

A few things to notice:

- the natural log is *strictly increasing* (never plateaus or goes down);
- it increases veeery slowly;
- it is only defined for strictly positive numbers;
- it returns both positive and negative values;
- there is a vertical asymptote at $x=0$.

So, word to the wise: if you find yourself plugging negative numbers into the natural log, you've probably made a mistake someplace. 

Anyhow, the natural logarithm has several properties you need to know. Let $x$ and $y$ be arbitrary positive numbers, and let $c$ be any real number (could be negative):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ln(xy)&=\ln(x)+\ln(y)\\
\ln\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)&=\ln(x)-\ln(y)\\
\ln(x^c)&=c\ln(x)\\
\ln(1/x)&=-\ln(x)\\
\ln(e^x)&=x\\
\ln(e)&=1\\
\ln(1)&=0.
\end{aligned}
$$
