In this lab you will get some basic practice with the tools `R` provides for working with special families of (absolutely) continuous random variables. Fortunately, these are the same tools you saw for discrete random variables in [Lab 5](https://sta240-f25.github.io/labs/lab-5.html): the `p-`, `d-`, `r-` functions.

# The normal distribution

Imagine you are a theater producer. Your most recent smash hit was the musical *Quiet!*, a light, frothy adaptation of [*All Quiet on the Western Front*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front). Your next project is a co-production with the Duke University Department of Statistical Science. It's called *Tidy!*, and it features such rollicking numbers as “`pivot` the Night Away” and “`facet_wrap`ped in Your Love.” 

Let $X$ represent the return-on-investment (ROI) for this new musical, which you can think of as ROI = (GAIN - INVESTMENT) / INVESTMENT. As I learned from [this recent article](https://sta240-f25.github.io/readings/detsky-gutekunst-kopac-2025-significance.pdf) in *Significance* magazine, investing in musicals is a risky business. You could make a killing, or you could lose your shirt. If $X=0$, you broke even. If $X>0$ you made money, and you have a hit if $X$ is huge. If $X<0$ you lost money, and if you used any *debt* or *leverage* in your financing, then $X$ could be arbitrarily large in the wrong direction. All of these are possible. Furthermore, $X$ is a proportion of money, and its value is uncertain. As such, it may be appropriate to model $X$ as a continuous random variable that can take on any value in $\mathbb{R}$. 

By far the most famous model for such a variable is the **normal distribution**. Its density is the familiar *bell curve*, which you can play around with in this [explainer](https://sta240-f25.github.io/distributions/continuous-normal.html). In what follows, imagine that $X\sim\text{N}(\mu,\,\sigma^2)$, and historical experience tells us that returns are 0.1 (10%) on average with a standard deviation of 0.3.

## Task 1

What is the probability that $X$ will be exactly equal to 0.377?

## Task 2

What is the probability that $X$ will be somewhere between 0.35 and 0.4?

## Task 3

What is the probability that $X$ will be negative?

## Task 4

Simulate `n = 5000` realizations of $X$ and then verify that the sample mean, the sample standard deviation, and the sample proportion of negative values agree with the "true," theoretical numbers.

## Set a seed!
To ensure that your numbers are reproducible and you get the same results every time you render your document, set a random number seed of your choosing.

## Task 5

Plot a histogram of your random numbers from the previous part, and overlay a line plot of the "true" density.


# The gamma distribution

![](images/stupid-planking.jpg){#fig-planking fig-align="center" width="50%"}

When I was in high school (2008 - 2012), a ridiculous fad emerged called "planking," where people would photograph themselves in weird locations lying face down and stiff-as-a-board, as in @fig-planking. It was really stupid. In a few sad cases, people chose to do this from great heights and accidentally plummeted to their deaths. 

In addition to being a theater producer, imagine that you also own an insurance company that specializes in planking-related injuries. Every month, people submit claims against their policies for some amount of money. Let $X$ represent the total dollar amount that your clients claim next month. This is a random variable because insurance claims are the result of random accidents. $X$ is measured in units of dollars and cents, so it is most appropriate to model $X$ as a continuous random variable that only takes on positive values. 

A common model for such a variable is the **gamma distribution**, which has density:

$$
f(x)
=
\begin{cases}
\frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)}x^{\alpha-1}e^{-\beta x} &x\geq 0\\
0 & x<0.
\end{cases}
$$

A random variable possessing this distribution is denoted $X\sim\text{Gamma}(\alpha,\,\beta)$, and the parameters $\alpha>0$ and $\beta>0$ are called the *shape* and the *rate.* Once we have the appropriate tools, we will derive that $E(X)=\alpha/\beta$ and $\text{var}(X)=\alpha/\beta^2$, but for now you can just take these as facts. Our webpage has an [explainer](https://sta240-f25.github.io/distributions/continuous-gamma.html) with more.

## Task 6

The actuaries at your insurance company know that historically, monthly claims are about \$10,000 on average, with a standard deviation of \$2,000. If we want to use the model $X\sim\text{Gamma}(\alpha,\,\beta)$, how should we set $\alpha$ and $\beta$ so that $X$ has the correct location and spread?

## Task 7

Simulate `n = 5000` random numbers from the gamma distribution using the appropriate `r-` function. Plot a histogram of these numbers using the `hist` function, and overlay a line plot of the density using the `curve` function and the appropriate `d-` function.

## Task 8

Verify that the sample mean and sample variance of your random numbers are close to the prescriptions from Task 6. If they are not, revisit Task 6 and adjust your choice of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ until this works.

## Task 9

What is the probability $P(X > 15,000)$? Calculate this probability exactly using the appropriate `p-` function, and also approximate it using your random numbers. Verify that the two numbers are close.
