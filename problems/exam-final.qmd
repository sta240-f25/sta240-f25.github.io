title: "Final Exam Study Guide"
draft: true
---

Our final exam is **Friday December 12 from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM**. There will be 11 problems, and they will break down as follows:

0.  (an undisclosed check on your visual intuition)
1.  Probability spaces and rules
2.  Counting (ugh!)
3.  Conditional probability and independence
4.  Discrete random variables
5.  Absolutely continuous random variables
6.  The moment-generating function
7.  Transformations of random variables
8.  Joint distributions
9.  Maximum likelihood estimation
10. Bayesian inference

Problems 0 - 8 will be similar to the midterms. Since you've had more time to live with this material, I reserve the right to include problems that might stretch you a bit. For Problems 9 and 10, I assure you there will be no surprises. You can expect problems that are exactly like the examples you've seen in lecture, lab, Problem Set 7, and this study guide. The distributions may be different, but the format and the steps are the same. If you work every practice problem from scratch on your own and then study the solutions carefully, you are ready.

## Reminder

If your final exam score is better than your lowest midterm score, I will replace the low midterm with the final.
