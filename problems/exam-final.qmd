Below are at least two practice problems for each of these ten items, as well as guidance about what course materials to refer to if you want more review on a particular topic.

## Give your cheat sheet some TLC!

You are allowed two resources on the exam:

- a "dumb" calculator (no wi-fi). You will not need it, but if you want it as a security blanket, be my guest;
- both sides of one 8.5" x 11" sheet of notes, prepared by you and you alone. You can create it however you wish: handwritten, on a computer, etc.

Do not skimp on the cheat sheet! Students in past semesters have neglected their cheat sheets to their detriment. Get an early start, and give it some elbow grease.
