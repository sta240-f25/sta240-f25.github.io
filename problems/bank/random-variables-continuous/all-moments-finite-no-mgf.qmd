Here is the cdf of an absolutely continuous random variable $X$:

$$
F(x)
=
\begin{cases}
1-\exp\left(-\sqrt{x}\right)&x\geq 0\\
0&\text{else}.
\end{cases}
$$


a. What is $P(4\leq X < 9)$?
a. What is the pdf of $X$?
a. Compute $E(X^n)$ for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
a. What is the variance of $X$?
a. What is the median of $X$?

## Hint
All of the moments of this distribution are finite, but nevertheless, it doesn't have a moment-generating function (MGF). So you'll hit a dead-end if you try using that to compute the moments. Instead, use LOTUS. It's a subtle calculation, but it actually works out pretty nice.
