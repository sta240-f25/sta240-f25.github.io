Consider this function:

$$
F(x) = \begin{cases}
1 - e^{-g(x)} & x\geq 0\\
0 & \text{else}.
\end{cases}
$$

Assume $g(x)$ is continuous. I want $F(x)$ to be a continuous function, and I want $F(x)$ to be a valid cumulative distribution function (CDF). What properties must $g(x)$ satisfy in order to make that happen? Give three examples of $g$ that have these properties.
