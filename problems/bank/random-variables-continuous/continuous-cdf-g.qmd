Consider this function:

$$
F(x) = \begin{cases}
1 - e^{-g(x)} & x\geq 0\\
0 & \text{else}.
\end{cases}
$$

Assume $g(x)$ is continuous. What properties must $g(x)$ satisfy in order for $F(x)$ to be a valid cumulative distribution function (CDF) for a *continuous* random variable? Give three examples of functions $g(x)$ that satisfy these properties.
