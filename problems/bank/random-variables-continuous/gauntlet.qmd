Consider a nonnegative, absolutely continuous random variable with cdf

$$
F_X(x)
=
\begin{cases}
1 - \exp\left(-\frac{x^2}{2}\right) & x\geq 0
\\
0 & x<0.
\end{cases}
$$

a.  What is $P(2\leq X\leq 3)$;
b.  What is the density of $X$?
c.  What is $E(X^n)$ for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$?
d.  What is $\text{var}(X)$?
e.  What is the median of $X$?
