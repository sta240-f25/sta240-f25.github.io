If the discrete random variable $X$ has the *funky-ass distribution* (*FAS*), then its range is $\text{Range}(X)=\mathbb{N}$ and its pmf is 

$$
P(X=k)=\binom{k+r-1}{k}(1-p)^kp^r\quad k=0,\,1,\,2,\,3,\,...,
$$

where the parameters $r\in\mathbb{N}$ and $0<p<1$ are constants. We denote this $X\sim\text{FAS}(r,\,p)$. 

a. Use what you know about probability to find the value of this infinite series:

$$
\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty 
\binom{k+r-1}{k}(1-p)^k.
$$

b. Compute the MGF of $X$;
c. Use the definition of the expected value to compute the mean of $X$;
d. Use the MGF to compute the mean of $X$ and verify that you get the same answer you got before;
e. Consider an iid collection $X_i\overset{\text{iid}}{\sim}\text{FAS}(r,\,p)$ and derive the distribution of the sum $S_n=\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$.
