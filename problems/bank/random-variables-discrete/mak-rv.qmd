Let $X$ be a random variable with the following pmf:

::: {.center-table}
| $x$ | $P(X=x)$ |
|-----|----------|
| -1  | 0.500    |
| 0   | 0.250    |
| 1   | 0.125    |
| 2   | 0.125    |
:::

a.  What is the mean of $X$?
b.  What is the pmf of $Y = 2X-3$?
c.  What is the mean of $Y$?
d.  What is the pmf of $W = X^2$?
e.  What is the mean of $W$?
f.  What is the conditional pmf of $X$ given $X \neq 0$?
g.  What is the conditional mean of $X$ given $X \neq 0$?
