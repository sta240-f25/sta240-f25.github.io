Let $Z\sim\text{N}(0,\,1)$, and recall what that means:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f_Z(z)&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}z^2\right), && -\infty<z<\infty\\
M_Z(t)&=\exp\left(\frac{1}{2}t^2\right), && -\infty<t<\infty.
\end{aligned}
$$

Next, let $X=\mu+\sigma Z$ for some  constants $\mu\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\sigma>0$.

a. Use the change-of-variables formula to derive density of $X$. What is its distribution?
a. What is the moment-generating function of $X$?
a. What are the mean and variance of $X$? Make sure you justify your answer with some type of derivation.
a. Consider $X_1,\,X_2,\,...,\,X_n\overset{\text{iid}}{\sim}\text{N}(\mu,\,\sigma^2)$ and derive the distribution of their sum and their average.
