Consider this Bayesian model:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\theta&\sim\text{N}(m_0,\,\tau_0^2)\\
X_{1:n}\mid\theta&\overset{\text{iid}}{\sim}\text{N}(\theta,\,1).
\end{aligned}
$$



a. What is the posterior distribution for $\theta$ conditional on the data?
a. Derive the posterior mean and show that it is a convex combination of the prior mean $m_0$ and the MLE.
a. The posterior mean can be thought of as an alternative estimator, in a classical sense. So, what are its mean, variance, bias, and MSE?
a. Is it possible for this new estimator to be superior (lower MSE) than the pure MLE?
