Consider this joint distribution for random variables $X$ and $Y$, written in hierarchical form:

$$
\begin{aligned}
X&\sim\text{Gamma}\left(\alpha,\,\beta\right)\\
Y\mid X=x&\sim \text{Exponential}(x).
\end{aligned}
$$


a. Sketch the joint range of $(X,\, Y)$.
a. What is the joint density of the random pair $(X,\, Y)$?
a. What is the marginal density of $Y$?
a. What is the density of $X$ conditional on the event $Y=y$? Is it recognizable?
