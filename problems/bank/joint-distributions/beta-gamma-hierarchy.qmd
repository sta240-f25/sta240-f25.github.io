Consider a random pair $(X,\,Y)$ with a joint distribution given by this hierarchy:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    X
    &\sim 
    \textrm{Beta}(a,\, b)
    \\
    Y\mid X = x 
    &\sim 
    \textrm{Gamma}\left(a+b,\, \frac{c}{x}\right).
\end{aligned}
$$

a. What is the joint range?
a. What is the marginal density of $Y$?
a. What is the conditional density of $X$?
