Let $A_1,\,A_2,\,A_3,\,...\subseteq S$ be an infinite sequence of possibly overlapping events in some probability space. Based on this arbitrary sequence, define a new sequence of events that starts with $B_1 = A_1$ and then has $B_i=A_i\cap \left(\bigcup_{j=1}^{i-1}A_j\right)^c$ for all $i>1$.

a.  Show that the $B_i$ are pairwise disjoint.

b.  Show that

$$
\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i=\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty B_i.
$$

c.  Use the previous parts to show that

$$
P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right)\leq\sum\limits_{i=1}^\infty P(A_i).
$$
