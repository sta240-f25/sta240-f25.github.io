Let $S$ be a sample space, and consider events $A,\, B,\, C\subseteq S$. Recall that the law of inclusion/exclusion says that

$$
P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B).
$$

a.  How should this be extended to unions of three events? $$
    P(A\cup B\cup C)=P(A)+P(B)+P(C) +\,...{???}
    $$ Explain your conjecture with words and pictures.

b.  Use set theory and the probabiity axioms to prove your conjecture in the previous part.
