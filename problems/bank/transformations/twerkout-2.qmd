This is an important technical skill, so let's drill it. For each of these, plot the transformation and then derive the range and the density of the new distribution:

a. Let $X\sim\text{Unif}(0,\,1)$ and consider $Y=1/X$;
a. Let $X$ have density $f_X(x)=42x^5(1-x)$ for $0<x<1$ and consider $Y=X^3$;
a. Let $X\sim\text{Exponential}(\lambda)$ and consider $Y=4X+3$;
a. Let $X$ have cdf $F_X(x)=(x+1)^3/8$ for $-1<x<1$ and consider $Y=1-X^2$;
a. Let $X\sim\text{N}(0,\,1)$ and consider $Y=|X|$.
