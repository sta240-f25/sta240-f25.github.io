Suppose you are dealt six cards from a well-shuffled, standard deck of 52.

a.  What is the probability of getting 3 of one rank and 3 of another?
b.  What is the probability of getting 4 of one rank and 2 of another?
c.  What is the probability of getting 3 aces and 3 of another rank?
d.  What is the probability of getting 4 of one rank and 2 aces?
e.  What is the probability that all 6 cards are in the same suit?
f.  What is the probability that all 6 cards are consecutive (ie a hand with 3 hearts, 4 spades, 5 spades, 6 clubs, 7 hearts, and the 8 diamonds)? Assume that the ace can only be the high card;
g.  What is the answer to the previous question if we allow the ace to be either high or low?
h.  What is the probability of receiving the ace, king, queen, jack, 10 and 9 all in hearts?
