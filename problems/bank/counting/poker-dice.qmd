Poker dice is played by simultaneously rolling five dice. The dice are fair, six-sided, and *distinct* (imagine that each one is a different color). Find the probabilities of the following dice rolls:

a. five different numbers;
b. three of a kind (three dice show the same number, while the other two dice are singles);
c. full house (three dice show the same number, while the other two show a separate pair).
