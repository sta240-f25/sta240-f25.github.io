Consider selecting $k$ from $n$ with replacement but ignoring order.

a. Let's take the specific case of $k=2$ and $n=4$. List out all possible ways you can select $k=2$ items from $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ in such a scenario.
b. Let $x_i$ be the number of times that element $\{i\}$ is selected, for each $i = 1,\,2,\,3,\, 4$. For each combination identified in (a), show that it satisfies the following equation:

$$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 2, \quad x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \in \{0, 1, 2\}.$$

c. State an analogous equation to part b for general $n$ and $k$. Use this to show that the number of ways you can select $k$ from $n$ without replacement and ignoring order is

$$
\binom{n+k-1}{k}=\frac{(n+k-1)!}{k!(n-1)!}.
