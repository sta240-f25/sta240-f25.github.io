Consider a sequence of $n$ independent coin flips of a fair coin. Define a streak of heads as an uninterrupted run of heads, and efine a streak of tails analogously. We are interested in the number of streaks in a sequence of flips. For example, consider the sequence below:

$$
hhhttthhttthhhhhthtthhhh.
$$

It contains 9 streaks. Here is the sequence again with the streaks separated:


$$
hhh\quad ttt\quad hh\quad ttt\quad hhhhh\quad t\quad h\quad tt\quad hhhh.
$$

In a sequence of $n$ flips of a fair coin, let $Y$ be the number of streaks. What is the range of $Y$, and what is its PMF?
