Let $B_{10}$ be the set of all length-10 binary strings. So for example, (1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1) is an element of the set $B_{10}$. Now, consider that we randomly draw two strings from the set $B_{10}$ with replacement:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{a}
&=
(a_1,\,a_2,\,a_3,\,...,\,a_{10})\in B_{10}\\
\mathbf{b}
&=
(b_1,\,b_2,\,b_3,\,...,\,b_{10})\in B_{10}.
\end{aligned}
$$

If we multiply the entries and add

$$
X=a_1b_1+a_2b_2+\cdots +a_{10}b_{10},
$$

what is the probability that the sum $s$ is equal to $k$, for each $k=0,\,1,\,2,\,3,\,...,\,10$?

a. Derive a generic formula for $P(X=k)$ that is a function of $k$, but then plug into your formula and produce an $11\times 2$ table listing the actual decimal numbers for each $k$;
b. Write a lil' program in `R` that simulates 10,000 random trials of this phenomenon. Tally up the number of times you get each value of $k$, and compare the empirical proportions to the actual probabilities in part a. In a large enough number of trials, they should be close by the *law of large numbers*, which we will study in a month or two.
