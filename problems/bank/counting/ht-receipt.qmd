A few months ago I went to Harris Teeter to get some junk food, and when I looked at my receipt, I saw this:

I thought, "Strange. What are the odds the total would be a whole number?" Well, let's find out!

a. Imagine you randomly purchase two items that each cost less than $10, and assume all prices are equally likely. The prices of the two items are quoted to two decimal places. What is the probability that the two prices add up to a whole number total?
b. Now let's add a wrinkle. Imagine sales tax is 5%. This is calculated, *rounded up* to the nearest cent, and then added to your bill. What is the probability that the cost of the two items plus the rounded sales tax adds up to a whole number?

## Hint

The answer to part b is roughly 0.01, but showing this is tricky. Give it a shot!
