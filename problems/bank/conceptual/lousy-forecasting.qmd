Here is a list of events that may or may not happen, but I believe we will know the final outcome before the end of the semester:

-   Zohran Mamdani wins the New York City mayoral election;
-   *Wicked: For Good* makes more money (inflation adjusted) on its opening weekend than *Wicked: Part I*;
-   "The Epstein files" (whatever the hell those even are) are somehow made publicly available;
-   Duke University settles with the Trump administration (need to make this more precise)
-   Something to do with Duke Football
-   Team X makes it to the world series (ask Max what the best framing is)
-   Diddy sentencing, or some other court thing
-   some silly gen z thing (ask TAs)

Choose one of these, state the probability that you assign to the event happening, and explain in a few paragraphs how you formulated your belief. What reasoning and evidence did you consider, and how did you weigh it? Feel free to provide links to online sources as needed.
