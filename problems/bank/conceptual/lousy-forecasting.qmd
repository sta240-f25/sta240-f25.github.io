Here is a list of events that may or may not happen, but I believe we will know the final outcome before the end of the semester:

-   Zohran Mamdani wins the New York City mayoral election;
-   *Wicked: For Good* makes more money (inflation adjusted) on its opening weekend than *Wicked: Part I*;
-   The Philadelphia Phillies make it to the 2025 World Series;
-   Sean Combs is sentenced to prison for more than 3 years;
-   More Duke undergraduates participate in this year's [Marriage Pact](https://dukechronicle.com/article/duke-university-duke-fluke-marriage-pacts-match-students-surveys-romantic-platonic-matches-student-experiences-behind-the-scenes-questions-personalities-campus-tradition-20250124) than last year's;
-   (something about Duke settling with the Trump admin?)
-   (something about Epstein?)
-   (something about Duke football?)
-   (something silly and youth-y, ask Liane)

Choose one of these, state the probability that you assign to the event happening, and explain in a few paragraphs how you formulated your belief. What reasoning and evidence did you consider, and how did you weigh it? Feel free to provide links to online sources as needed.
