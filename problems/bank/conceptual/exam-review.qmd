Sadly, we have a midterm exam coming up on Thursday October 9. Everything you have seen on Problem Sets 1 through 4 is fair game for the exam: set theory, probability spaces and axioms, probability rules and proofs, counting, conditional probability and independence, and discrete random variables.

Look back through the course materials thus far and select the topic that you think you understand the *least*. Study this topic carefully and then do two things:

a. Write a few paragraphs where you explain this topic to a five-year-old using only words, pictures, and toy examples;
a. After you're done reviewing, and after your response to part a, include one thing you're still unsure about or a question youâ€™d like to ask about your chosen topic.

After you submit this problem set, I will answer all of the class's questions and post an anonymized "Q&A" as part of the exam review materials.
