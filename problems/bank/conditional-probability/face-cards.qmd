In a standard deck of $52$ cards, 3 (Jack, Queen, and King) of the 13 ranks are collectively known as the "face cards" of the deck. Recall that a standard deck of $52$ cards also has $4$ suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades).

Suppose you deal out two cards from the deck. What is the probability that they are both face cards given that they are both hearts?
