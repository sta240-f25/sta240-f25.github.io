A JP Morgan recruiter is walking around campus with three bone-colored business cards. Two of the cards are normal; they have writing on one side and they are blank on the other. The third card was misprinted; the writing was duplicated on both sides. The recruiter drops one of the cards and orders his valet to pick it up. When the valet reaches for the card, he sees writing facing up. What is the probability that the recruiter dropped the misprinted card?
