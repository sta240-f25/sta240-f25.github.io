Pearl Bailey and Elaine Stritch go target shooting. Suppose that each of Pearl's shots hits a wooden duck target with probability $p_1$, while each shot of Elaine's hits it with probability $p_2$, independent of Pearl. Suppose that they shoot simultaneously at the same target. If the wooden duck is knocked over (indicating that it was hit), what is the probability that both shots hit the duck?
