An encryption algorithm generates a seed value $z$ in the following way:

-   A binary operator is chosen at random from $\{+,\,\cdot\}$;

-   Two *distinct* numbers $x$ and $y$ are chosen at random from the set $\{1,\,2,\,...,\,9\}$ and the binary operation chosen above acts on $x$ and $y$ to produce $z$.

a.  What is the probability that $z$ is an even number?
b.  You notice that the algorithm generates an even $z$ value. Given this, what is the probability that the $+$ operator was used to generate it?
