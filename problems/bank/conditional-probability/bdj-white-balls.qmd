An urn contains 5 white and 10 black balls. Four tickets labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4 reside in a box. A ticket is drawn at random from the box, and that number of balls is randomly chosen from the urn, without replacement.

a.  What is the probability that all of the balls drawn are white?
b.  If we learn that all balls drawn from the urn are white, what is the conditional probability that the #3 ticket was drawn?
