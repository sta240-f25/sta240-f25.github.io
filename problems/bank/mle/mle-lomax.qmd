Let $X_1$, $X_2$, ..., $X_n$ be iid from some member of the parametric family that you met on Midterm 2:

$$
f(x\,|\,\theta)=\theta(x+1)^{-(\theta+1)},\quad x>0.
$$

a.  What is the maximum likelihood estimator of $\theta>0$?
a.  What is the sampling distribution of the estimator? Problem 14 might be helpful here.
a.  What is the MSE of the estimator?
