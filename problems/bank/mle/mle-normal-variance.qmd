Consider these data:

$$
X_1,\,X_2,\,...,\,X_n\overset{\text{iid}}{\sim}\text{N}(0,\,\theta).
$$

a.  What is the maximum likelihood estimator of $\theta>0$?
a.  What is the sampling distribution of the estimator?
a.  What is the MSE of the estimator?
a.  Based on the MSE, what are the statistical properties of this estimator?
