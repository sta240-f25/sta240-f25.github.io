Let $X_1$, $X_2$, ..., $X_n$ be iid from some member of this parametric family:

$$
f(x\,|\,\theta)
=
\frac{1}{2\theta}\exp\left(-\frac{|x|}{\theta}\right), \quad -\infty<x<\infty.
$$

a.  What is the maximum likelihood estimator of $\theta>0$?
a.  What is the sampling distribution of the estimator?
a.  What is the MSE of the estimator?
a.  Based on the MSE, what are the statistical properties of this estimator?
