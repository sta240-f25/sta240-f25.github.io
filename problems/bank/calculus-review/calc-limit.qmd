Let $f$ be any function with the following properties:

-   $f$ is twice continuously differentiable in a neighborhood of zero[^1];
-   $f(0) = 0$;
-   $f'(0) = 0$;
-   $f''(0) = 1$.

Assume $t$ is a constant and compute

$$
    \lim_{x\to\infty} xf\left(\frac{t}{\sqrt{x}}\right)
    .
$$

## Continuity?

A full credit solution must clearly explain how and why continuity is being used along the way.

[^1]: This means that $f$ and its first two derivatives are all continuous functions at and around zero.
