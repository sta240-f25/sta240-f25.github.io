Here is a very silly function:

$$
h(x)
=
\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{\sigma^2}\right)
,\quad 
-\infty<x<\infty
.
$$

Treat $-\infty<\mu<\infty$ and $\sigma>0$ as constants and compute the value(s) of $x$ at which $h$ has *inflection points*.

## Hint

Here is an example of what $h$ might look like in the special case where $\mu = 1$ and $\sigma=2$:

```{r}
#| label: silly
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-asp: 0.5
m = 1
s = 2
par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.1, 4))
curve(exp(-0.5 * ((x - m) / s)^2), 
      from = -6, to = 8, n = 500,
      xlab = "x", ylab = "h(x)",
      xaxt = "n")
axis(1, at = -6:8)
```

Before you start doing any math, can you use the picture to guess what the answer will be?
