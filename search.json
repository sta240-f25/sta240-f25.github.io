    "text": "Testing positive for a disease is not exactly good news, but how alarmed you should be ultimately depends on a few factors: the accuracy of the test and the overall rarity of the disease (the so-called base rate). Before you walk into the doctor’s office, the probability that you are sick is \\(P(D=+)\\), the prevalence. This is the unconditional (or marginal) probability that a random member of the population (ie you in that moment) is sick. After you test positive, the revised or conditional probability that you have the disease is given by Bayes’ theorem:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(D = +\\,|\\,T=+)\n&=\n\\frac{{\\color{blue}{P(T=+\\,|\\,D=+)}}{\\color{red}{P(D=+)}}}{P(T=+)}\n\\\\\n&=\n\\frac{{\\color{blue}{P(T=+\\,|\\,D=+)}}{\\color{red}{P(D=+)}}}{{\\color{blue}{P(T=+\\,|\\,D=+)}}{\\color{red}{P(D=+)}}+[1-{\\color{green}{P(T=-\\,|\\,D=-)}}][1-{\\color{red}{P(D=+)}}]}\n\\\\\n&=\n\\frac{{\\color{blue}{\\text{TPR}}}\\times{\\color{red}{\\text{PREV}}}}{{\\color{blue}{\\text{TPR}}}\\times{\\color{red}{\\text{PREV}}}+(1-{\\color{green}{\\text{TNR}}})(1-{\\color{red}{\\text{PREV}}})}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\(P(T=+\\,|\\,D=+)\\) is the true positive rate or sensitivity: the probability that a sick person is correctly diagnosed. \\(P(T=-\\,|\\,D=-)\\) is the true negative rate or specificity: the probability that a well person is correctly diagnosed. It is the nonlinear interaction of three numbers (prevalence, TPR, and TNR) that determines the revised likelihood that you have the disease. Two numbers interacting linearly is about all a regular human can handle off the dome, hence people are generally bad at reasoning about this stuff.\nThe application below visualizes the sample space for our simple model of disease testing. We have \\(D\\in\\{-,,\\,+\\}\\) and \\(T\\in\\{-,\\,+\\}\\), and so there are four individual outcomes:\n\n\\(P(T = +\\cap D=+)=P(T=+\\,|\\,D=+)P(D=+)=\\text{TPR}\\times P(D=+)\\);\n\\(P(T = +\\cap D=-)=P(T=+\\,|\\,D=-)P(D=-)=\\text{FPR}\\times P(D=-)\\);\n\\(P(T = -\\cap D=-)=P(T=-\\,|\\,D=-)P(D=-)=\\text{TNR}\\times P(D=-)\\);\n\\(P(T = -\\cap D=+)=P(T=-\\,|\\,D=+)P(D=+)=\\text{FNR}\\times P(D=+)\\).\n\nThe application plots the \\([0,\\,1]\\times[0,\\,1]\\) unit square, partitioned into four rectangles representing the outcomes listed above.

    "text": "Statistical computing software like R can generate (pseudo)random numbers, like this:\n\nsample(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), 5, replace = TRUE)\n\n[1] 1 4 1 2 5\n\n\nOr this:\n\nrbinom(5, 50, 0.3)\n\n[1] 20 16 16 10 12\n\n\nOr this:\n\nrnorm(5)\n\n[1] -0.928567035 -0.294720447 -0.005767173  2.404653389  0.763593461\n\n\nLook pretty random to me. This allows us to perform simulations, which is an important part of the modern statistician’s toolkit. Having said that, when you’re working with computer-generated random numbers, you want your work to be reproducible so that other people can check it. This means that you want to set a random number seed before you do a simulation. This ensures that the stream of random numbers in your simulation is the same every time, and someone else could run your code and get the exact same results that you did.\nSetting a seed looks like this:\n\nset.seed(8675309)\n\nrnorm(5)\n\n[1] -0.9965824  0.7218241 -0.6172088  2.0293916  1.0654161\n\n\nEvery time you run that code, you will get the same numbers:\n\nset.seed(8675309)\n\nrnorm(5)\n\n[1] -0.9965824  0.7218241 -0.6172088  2.0293916  1.0654161\n\n\nSo, if you ever write a code chunk that generates random numbers (eg. using the sample function or one of the r- functions), you should begin the code chunk by setting a random number seed so that you get the same results every time you run your stuff. The syntax as you saw above is set.seed(INTEGER). Sometimes we will tell you what number to use. Other times (and once you exit the course), you can put whatever you want. It doesn’t really matter. If you require inspiration, try these:\n\n1\n20\n988\n24601\n362436\n525600\n8675309\n8005882300",

    "text": "This is a course on the mathematics of probability and statistics. In probability, we describe the distribution of a random phenomenon and then study how the realizations of that phenomenon typically behave.

We will spend twelve weeks on the first, and then three weeks on the second. Topics include set theory, probability spaces, counting methods, conditional probability, discrete and (absolutely) continuous random variables, transformations of random variables, (pseudo)random number generation, bivariate distributions, concentration inequalities, limit theorems, maximum likelihood estimation, and Bayesian inference with conjugate priors.\nAside from the concrete topics, the course emphasizes four generic intellectual themes:\n\nStudents in this class will improve their mathematical maturity.

If you get one, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the limit does not exist. It just means that the jury is still out; it’s indeterminate. To continue investigating, you can use a tool called L’Hôpital’s rule. Whenever \\(\\lim_{x\\to c}f(x)=\\lim_{x\\to c}g(x)=0\\) or \\(\\pm\\infty\\), the rule says that\n\\[\n\\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}.\n\\] The hope is that the new function \\(f'(x)/g'(x)\\) will be well-behaved at \\(c\\), meaning you can simplify by just plugging in. However, after applying L’Hôpital’s rule once and trying to plug-in, you may still get an indeterminate form. In that case, you’ll have to take another round of derivatives, and maybe another after that, until the clouds finally part and the sun shines upon you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: multiple rounds of L’Hôpital’s\n\n\n\nConsider:\n\\[\n\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{(\\ln x)^2}{x}.\n\\]\n\\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}(\\ln x)^2=\\infty\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}x=\\infty\\), so let’s take some derivatives:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}x}(\\ln x)^2&=\\frac{2\\ln x}{x}\\\\\n\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}x}x&=1.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] The ratio of derivatives is thus \\(2(\\ln x)/x\\), but this still gives an indeterminate form because \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}2\\ln x=\\infty\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}x=\\infty\\), so we have to go again:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}x}2\\ln x&=\\frac{2}{x}\\\\\n\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}x}x&=1.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] The ratio of these derivatives is just \\(2/x\\), and that goes to 0 as \\(x\\to \\infty\\).

    "text": "The gamma function is a continuous function that interpolates the factorials. It is an interesting mathematical object in its own right, but for students of probability, it appears in the normalizing constant of the gamma density, and recognizing the gamma function is a useful technique for simplifying certain integrals.\nDefinition\nHere it is:\n\\[\n\\Gamma(x)=\\int_0^\\infty z^{x-1}e^{-z}\\,\\text{d}z,\\quad x &gt;0.\n\\]\nPay attention. \\(x\\) is the argument to the function. It’s treated as a constant. \\(z\\) is the dummy variable of integration. It doesn’t affect the actual value of the expression, and you can change it to whatever you want: \\(y\\), \\(u\\), \\(t\\), whatever. At the end of the day, the value of the integral is just a number; plug in different \\(x\\) values, and you get different numbers. That’s the gamma function. Figure 1 displays the picture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\nR provides the gamma command for actually computing this:\n\ngamma(0.5) # √π\n\n[1] 1.772454\n\ngamma(1)   # 1\n\n[1] 1\n\ngamma(4)   # 3!\n\n[1] 6\n\ngamma(8)   # 7!\n\n[1] 5040\n\n\nProperties\nYou first met the gamma function on Problem Set 0, where you showed that it satisfies the following recursion:\n\\[\n\\Gamma(x+1) = x\\Gamma(x).\n\\]\nThat works for any real number \\(x&gt;0\\). But now let’s say you plug in an integer \\(n\\geq 2\\). As a result of the recursion, something cute happens:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Gamma(n)&=\\Gamma(n-1+1)\\\\\n&=(n-1)\\Gamma(n-1)\\\\\n&=(n-1)(n-2)\\Gamma(n-2)\\\\\n&=(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)\\Gamma(n-3)\\\\\n&\\vdots\\\\\n&=(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)\\cdots 3\\cdot2\\cdot\\Gamma(2)\\\\\n&=(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)\\cdots 3\\cdot2\\cdot1\\cdot\\Gamma(1)\\\\\n&=(n-1)!\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe last line follows because \\(\\Gamma(1)=\\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-x)\\,\\textrm{d}x=1\\) (shown here, but make sure you can do it yourself). The punchline is that the gamma function is a continuous function that interpolates the factorials. That is, it’s a smooth curve that “connects the dots,” like you see in Figure 1.\nThe gamma function has many funky properties that have kept mathematicians busy for a long time. For instance, \\(\\Gamma(1/2)=\\sqrt{\\pi}\\), which you showed on Problem Set 5. If you’re interested, there’s more where that came from.",

Gandalf says that a perfect blood test does exist, but it is very expensive, requiring the venom of a special lizard found only in the Morgul Vale. Each blood test would cost one gold piece, but the Royal Purse only has 500 gold pieces to spare, and there are 1000 soldiers that need to be tested. Gandalf sleeps on it and returns the next day with a plan for testing all of them that won’t break the bank:\n\nTake a blood sample from each of the 1000 soldiers;\nSplit each of these samples into two parts;\nTake one part of each sample and mix batches of ten of the samples together to create 100 mixed samples.\nTest each of those mixed samples;\nA few things could happen:\n\nIf the test gives a negative result, we know all of the original ten samples are clear, and we can move on;\nIf the test gives a positive result, then we know at least one of the original ten samples is positive. In that case we test the second part of the sample for each of the ten soldiers. We can then identify which soldiers are positive.\n\n\n\nGandalf finishes by saying “I expect sixty of the mixed batches to be negative. For the other forty batches, I expect the results to be positive, and hence we will have to test all four hundred of the original samples. This gives a total expected cost of 500 gold pieces.”\n\nWhat disease prevalence is Gandalf implicitly assuming here?\nCan Gandalf revise his scheme to reduce the expected cost even more?",

    "text": "Problem 6\nNot all election challenges are frivolous and cynical. Sometimes there are illegal/ineligible ballots in a close election, and if a candidate raises a legal challenge, a court must make a decision: certify the original results? adjust the vote totals somehow, possibly reversing the election? void the results entirely and order a new election? The concern of course is that the presence of the bad ballots might have swung the outcome, but how likely is this? Let’s model it.\nImagine an election where Angela Lansbury receives \\(a\\) votes, Bernadette Peters receives \\(b\\) votes, and Angela provisionally wins with a margin of victory \\(a-b&gt;0\\). However, of the total \\(a+b\\) votes, we learn that \\(k&gt;a-b\\) were invalid or illegal. But we know nothing else. We do not know who these folks are, where they came from, or who they voted for. We just know that they exist. If the \\(k\\) invalid ballots were removed from the total, what is the probability that it would flip the result of the election? If this probability is “too big,” we might start to worry.\nTo model this, think of the original \\(a+b\\) ballots as balls in the proverbial urn. \\(a\\) of these balls are red, and \\(b\\) of these balls are blue, and assume that \\(a,\\, b&gt;k\\). Removing the \\(k\\) invalid ballots is like drawing \\(k\\) balls out of the urn without replacement. Since we know nothing about the illegal ballots apart from the fact that they exist, assume that each of the \\(a+b\\) original ballots is equally likely to have been invalid. Next, imagine we randomly remove \\(k\\) balls from the urn, and let \\(X\\) be a random variable that counts the number of the removed/invalid ballots that belong to Angela. In other words, the number of red balls removed. If \\(X\\) is large enough, it will swing the election in Bernadette’s favor.\n\nWhat are the range and the pmf of the random variable \\(X\\)?\nFor what values of \\(X\\) does removing \\(k\\) ballots reverse the outcome of the election?\nBased on your answers to the previous parts, what is the probability that the election result is reversed when the \\(k\\) bad ballots are removed? Give a general formula for this probability, and then compute the probability for each of the real elections listed in Table 1;\nThe random variable \\(X\\) that you derived in the first part can be approximated by \\(\\text{Binom}(k,\\,1/2)\\). Explain why this approximation might be “good enough,” and verify that it’s not too bad by computing the approximate probability of reversal for the elections in Table 1. Compare the approximate probabilities to the actual ones from the previous part;\nLet’s say that we consider the probability of reversal “too big” if it is greater than 5%. Create a plot in R like Figure 1 with the following features:\n\nthe margin of victory \\(a-b\\) on the horizontal axis;\nthe number of bad ballots \\(k\\) on the vertical axis;\nscatterplot where each point represents an election in Table 1, with the points colored according to the decision that was made in the case;\ndivide the plane into two regions, one where the approximate probability of reversal is less than 0.05 and one where it is greater.\n\n\nWrite a few pithy paragraphs commenting on the following:\n\nthe assumptions of our lil’ model. Do you think they are innocuous? What might you change, and how?\nthe match or lack thereof between our model and the decisions that were actually made in the real cases;\nHow do you think a court should handle a legitimate election challenge? What are their responsibilities to the electorate, and what should they prioritize? Should they err on the side of upholding or voiding results? Should they think probabilistically? Should they consult this model, or one like it?\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Close elections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nelection\nyear\nwin\nloss\ntotal\nmargin\ninvalid\ndecision\n\n\n\nIppolito v.

    "text": "Quantum mechanics has a reputation for being an intimidating branch of theoretical physics, and JZ certainly doesn’t understand a ding dong thing about it. Even so, because we have studied some basic probability theory, the mathematics of quantum mechanics is more accessible than you might guess. Behold:\nImagine a single particle at the (sub)atomic level1. A particle’s quantum state encodes information about all of its measurable properties, such as position, momentum, spin, and energy. In quantum mechanics, measuring these properties is fundamentally probabilistic. Before measurement, the particle doesn’t have a single, definite position or momentum; it has only probabilities for the possible outcomes. The quantum state of a particle is fully characterized by its wave function, and the squared magnitude of the wave function is a probability density that describes the distribution of the particle’s position, or momentum, or whatever else you wish to study. Let’s explore this in a very simple example.\nConsider a single, one-dimensional particle located somewhere in the interval \\([0,\\,L]\\). The wave function associated with the particle’s quantum state is\n\\[\n\\psi_n(x)\n=\n\\begin{cases}\nA\\cdot\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}x\\right) & 0\\leq x\\leq L\\\\\n0 & \\text{else},\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere \\(A\\geq 0\\) is the amplitude, and \\(n=1,\\,2,\\,3,\\,...\\) indexes the particle’s energy level. The higher the energy level, the more “excited” the particle is. Behold:\nBecause the particle does not have a definite position before measurement, we treat the position \\(X_n\\in[0,\\,L]\\) of the particle as a continuous random variable whose probability density function is \\(f_n(x)=|\\psi_n(x)|^2\\)."

Spotify used to implement a pure random shuffle, but users complained that it was too patternful. For better or worse, the human brain is wired to detect meaningless patterns in random noise. For instance, the picture on the left is a “truly” random scatter of points; the one on the right is manipulated so the points don’t “clump”:\nWhen you survey people that don’t know any better, they often feel like the second picture is “more random” than the first because it lacks clumps, but this is a misunderstanding. A truly random playlist shuffle will often have clumps: clumps of artists, clumps of genres, etc. So when people say that they want “random,” what they really mean is just “variety” in some vague sense, and this is what Spotify shuffle tries to deliver.

But for us decrepit old hags that were foolish enough to defer adulthood to the autumn of their thirties, they can feel unavoidable. So how do these work? Whelp, I make a profile, someone else on the app reviews it for no more than three seconds, and if I meet enough of their criteria, they swipe right (like my profile). If I fail to meet their criteria, they swipe left. If we both like each other’s profiles, it’s a match. God help us.\nLet’s model this. When the other person reviews my profile, they are deciding if I possess qualities they value. What might those qualities be? Charm, humor, wealth, height, education, hygiene, style, a deep and abiding appreciation for the films of Luis Buñuel, etc. Figure 1 imagines that the set of potentially desirable qualities are balls in the proverbial urn. For the purposes of discussion, let’s say there are a total of one hundred qualities a person could potentially value (100 balls in the jar). Every human has a list of 8 that they care most about. Everyone’s different, so we will model a given person’s preferences as a random selection (without replacement!) of 8 balls from this jar of 100.\nSo, given a person’s preferences, will they like my profile? Well, let’s say that I possess exactly three of the one hundred desirable qualities. I won’t tell you what those three are, but suffice it to say, we have yet to list them in Figure 1. We will treat my three qualities as three red balls in the jar, and the remaining 97 are black. Next, let \\(A\\) be the event that at least two of my qualities are among the eight that a person values. If this happens, then they will swipe right on my profile.",

One strategy is to go on there, indiscriminately swipe right on everyone until you run out of people in your area, wait for the matches to roll in, and then filter through only those folks that have already expressed interest in you. The dating app creators know this is a possibility though, and so they cap the number of right swipes you can send in a 24 hour period (unless you buy a premium subscription). Let’s say that number is \\(n=25\\), as I believe it is on Bumble. So on a given day, I send 25 likes out into the world. How many of those \\(n=25\\) people will like me back, resulting in a match?

This skill complements a lot of the math we will be doing. In the modern era, mathematical reasoning and computer simulation are mutually reinforcing; you can check whether you did a calculation correctly by comparing with a simulation, and you can verify that a simulation result is legit by doing a proper calculation. Furthermore, in complex systems where the math is intractable, you can use simulation to explore what’s going on.\nDuring the semester, I will summarize the basic R skills we need in a series of concise “explainers” posted to the course webpage.

As such\n\\[\nP(A)=1-\\frac{\\binom{48}{5}}{\\binom{52}{5}}\\approx 0.34.\n\\]\nTo get the actual number, we can use the choose function in R.

    "text": "Task 3 (you do it)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: 8 safe rooks\n\n\n\n\nScenario: you randomly place 8 rooks on distinct squares of a chess board;\n\nEvent: all 8 rooks are safe from one another.\n\nFigure 1 displays an example of a safe position. In chess, rooks are permitted to move up-and-down or side-to-side as far as they want, but not diagonally or anything else.\nThis code creates a matrix representing the chess board, from which you can sample the random positions:\n\nboard &lt;- outer(letters[1:8], 1:8, paste0)\nboard\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8]\n[1,] \"a1\" \"a2\" \"a3\" \"a4\" \"a5\" \"a6\" \"a7\" \"a8\"\n[2,] \"b1\" \"b2\" \"b3\" \"b4\" \"b5\" \"b6\" \"b7\" \"b8\"\n[3,] \"c1\" \"c2\" \"c3\" \"c4\" \"c5\" \"c6\" \"c7\" \"c8\"\n[4,] \"d1\" \"d2\" \"d3\" \"d4\" \"d5\" \"d6\" \"d7\" \"d8\"\n[5,] \"e1\" \"e2\" \"e3\" \"e4\" \"e5\" \"e6\" \"e7\" \"e8\"\n[6,] \"f1\" \"f2\" \"f3\" \"f4\" \"f5\" \"f6\" \"f7\" \"f8\"\n[7,] \"g1\" \"g2\" \"g3\" \"g4\" \"g5\" \"g6\" \"g7\" \"g8\"\n[8,] \"h1\" \"h2\" \"h3\" \"h4\" \"h5\" \"h6\" \"h7\" \"h8\"\n\n\nHere’s an example of 8 random squares chosen for the rooks:\n\nrandom_position\n\n[1] \"g6\" \"h4\" \"h6\" \"f4\" \"d1\" \"c6\" \"d7\" \"d6\"\n\n\nSo that’s where your 8 rooks live. In order to check whether or not they are safe from one another, you might find it helpful to separate out the row information and the column information of the placement using the substring command:\n\nsubstring(random_position, 1, 1)\n\n[1] \"g\" \"h\" \"h\" \"f\" \"d\" \"c\" \"d\" \"d\"\n\nsubstring(random_position, 2, 2)\n\n[1] \"6\" \"4\" \"6\" \"4\" \"1\" \"6\" \"7\" \"6\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nboard &lt;- outer(letters[1:8], 1:8, paste0)\n\nset.seed(2025)\nnsim &lt;- 100000\ncount_safe &lt;- 0\n\nfor (i in 1:nsim) {\n  rooks &lt;- sample(board, 8)\n  \n  # split into rows (numbers) and cols (letters)\n  r &lt;- substring(rooks, 2, 2) # row = the number part\n  c &lt;- substring(rooks, 1, 1) # col = the letter part\n  \n  # safe if all 8 rows are different AND all 8 cols are different\n  if (length(unique(r)) == 8 & length(unique(c)) == 8) {\n    count_safe &lt;- count_safe + 1\n  }\n}\n\ncount_safe / nsim\n\n[1] 1e-05\n\n\n\nRecall that rooks can move up and down or side-to-side, but not diagonally. In order to be safe from one another, two rooks therefore need to occupy different rows and columns of the board. For the eight rooks to be mutually safe, they all must be in different columns and different rows from one another;\nThere are \\(n=8\\cdot 8=64\\) squares on the board, and we are selecting \\(k=8\\) of them at which to place the rooks. The rooks are identical, so order doesn’t matter, and it’s without replacement since the squares need to be distinct, and so the total number of possible outcomes is \\(\\#(S)=\\binom{64}{8}\\);\nThe event \\(A\\) we care about is “the rooks are safe from one another,” and this can happen \\(\\#(A)=8!\\) ways.\nWe know that a safe placement will have every row and column occupied by exactly one rook, so let us imagine building up a safe placement row-wise, starting from the bottom and working upward. There are 8 ways to place a single rook on the bottom row. No other rooks can go there, so we move to the next row. There are only 7 ways to place the next rook in the next row, because we must avoid the column occupied by the first rook. Similarly, there are only 6 ways to place the next rook in the next row, because we must avoid the two columns occupied by the first two rooks. And so on. As a consequence of the counting principle, where we regard each row as an experiment, we see that \\(\\#(A)=8\\times7\\times6\\times\\cdots\\times2\\times1=8!\\).\nSo\n\n\\[\nP(A)=\\frac{\\#(A)}{\\#(S)}=\\frac{8!}{\\binom{64}{8}}\\approx0.0000091095.\n\\].\n\nfactorial(8) / choose(64, 8)\n\n[1] 9.109465e-06",

    "text": "When we call rnorm or rgamma or rpois to generate random numbers from one of our special distributions, what is the computer actually doing? How do we program a computer to generate random numbers that behave according to some pre-defined distribution?\nAt the end of the day, all simulation methods revolve around a simple principle: “simulate from the standard uniform and then apply a transformation.” We statisticians take from granted that the computer scientists have devised good methods for generating random numbers from Unif(0, 1). The Mersenne Twister is a popular algorithm. Given that we can generate random numbers from the standard uniform, we need to figure out how to transform them into a batch of new random numbers that follow the distribution we want: normal, gamma, Cauchy, whatever.\n\nTask 0\nThe following theorem is a proof of concept that “simulate Unif(0, 1) and transform” is sufficient, at least in theory, to simulate any distribution we can think of:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem: inverse transform sampling\n\n\n\nLet \\(U\\sim \\text{Unif}(0,\\, 1)\\), and let \\(F\\) be any continuous cdf we are interested in. If we define a new random variable \\(X=F^{-1}(U)\\), then \\(X\\sim F\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\n\n\nFor simplicity, assume \\(F\\) is smooth and invertible. Things still work if it isn’t, but it makes the math a little cleaner. Furthermore, recall the cdf of the standard uniform \\(U\\sim\\text{Unif}(0,\\, 1)\\): \\[\n    F_U(x)=\\begin{cases}\n        0 & x \\leq 0\\\\\n        x & 0&lt;x&lt;1\\\\\n        1 & 1 \\leq x.\n    \\end{cases}\n\\]\n\\(X\\) is just a transformation of \\(U\\), so we can apply the cdf method. \\[\n    \\begin{align*}\n        F_X(x)\n        &=\n        P(X\\leq x)\n        \\\\\n        &=\n        P(F^{-1}(U)\\leq x)\n        \\\\\n        &=\n        P(U\\leq F(x))\n        \\\\\n        &=\n        F_U\\left(F(x)\\right)\n        \\\\\n        &=\n        F(x)\n        .\n    \\end{align*}\n\\]\nSo, the cdf of \\(X\\) is literally just \\(F\\).\n\n\n\nNow, in order to actually implement the algorithm, we need to be able to compute the inverse cdf \\(F^{-1}\\). In some cases, this may not be possible, and we must use a different transformation to actually get the job done. But the principle stands. Dig down deep enough into any simulation algorithm, and it’s just simulating uniforms and messing with them.\n\n\nTask 1\nConsider a random variable \\(X\\) with this density:\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{e^{-x}}{(1+e^{-x})^2},\\quad x\\in\\mathbb{R}.\n\\]\n\nCompute the cdf;\nCompute the inverse cdf;\nUse inverse transform sampling to generate n = 5000 random numbers from this distribution. Plot a histogram of the random numbers, and overlay a line plot of the original density function we gave you. If you did everything correctly, the histogram and the density should agree.\n\n\n\nTask 2\nConsider a random variable \\(X\\) with this density:\n\\[\nf(x) = xe^{-\\frac{1}{2}x^2},\\quad x\\geq 0.\n\\]\n\nCompute the cdf;\nCompute the inverse cdf;\nUse inverse transform sampling to generate n = 5000 random numbers from this distribution.

    "title": "Lab 4 - How does ChatGPT generate the next word?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "If you’ve ever asked ChatGPT a question, you may have noticed something; it generates its response one word at a time right before your eyes:\nWhat exactly is it doing? Well, ask it! If you do, the explanation will go something like this…\nChatGPT is an example of a large language model (LLM). Under the hood, there’s this fancy pants deep neural network machine learning mumbo jumbo that has been trained on a massive corpus of documents (books, newspaper articles, academic publications, reddit, all of Wikipedia, etc). When you ask it a question like “What color is the apple?”, the model asks itself “conditional on the text you just gave me, what is the likely next word?” Based on the text it was trained on and the underlying ML model, ChatGPT constructs a conditional probability distribution over the set of “next words” and simulates from it, like with the sample function. The new word that it simulates gets added to the end of the text you provided, and it repeats the process over again: given where we are now, what is the next word likely to be? And on and on…\nSo say you ask it “What color is the apple?” Based on that, the model constructs a probability distribution for \\(P(\\text{next word}\\,|\\,\\texttt{\"What color is the apple?\"})\\). The sample space \\(S\\) here is (basically) the set of all words that the model has seen. That set could be pretty big, but nevertheless it is finite, so we just need to list out all of the possible words together with their individual probabilities:\nOnce this is constructed, the model simulates from the distribution. You could imagine that the code might look something like sample(words, size = 1, prob = conditional_probs). So say that happens and the next word we simulate is “the.” That gets added to the end, and now we want to know \\(P(\\text{next word}\\,|\\,\\texttt{\"What color is the apple? the\"})\\). So we query the underlying model, and it constructs a new distribution on words, conditional on this revised context:\nNotice that the information we are conditioning on has changed, so the probabilities change. Based on the new probabilities, we simulate the next word. Let’s say it ends up being “apple.” So we add that to the end, and ask the model to construct a new distribution for \\(P(\\text{next word}\\,|\\,\\texttt{\"What color is the apple? the apple\"})\\):\nNow we simulate “is,” add that to the end, and query the model for \\(P(\\text{next word}\\,|\\,\\texttt{\"What color is the apple? the apple is\"})\\):\nWe see at this point that “red” is the most likely next word, but we are not searching the table for the most likely next word and slavishly returning it. We are simulating. So there’s a 35% chance we’ll come up with “red,” but also a non-trivial possibility that we’ll come up with “green.” You will notice that if you ask ChatGPT the exact same question multiple times (literally the identical text prompt), it returns different answers. That is because of this element of randomness.\nObviously, the elephant in the room in the above discussion is “where did the probabilities come from?” This is the magic, such as it is, of LLMs. In order to implement this scheme, we need to be able to construct a conditional probability distribution on words given any context. So no matter if you give it “What color is the apple” or “Explain string theory like I’m a genius” or “Why did my wife leave me” or “que se passe t’il,” it needs to come up with a meaningful and useful distribution for the next word, and it has to repeat this thousands if not millions of times. There are so many possibilities that it’s kind of bonkers to expect to be able to do this, but with enough data and computing power and a big enough model, apparently we can pull it off, at least some of the time.\nSo, the question of “where did the probabilities come from?” is sadly beyond the scope of our course. However, the question of “what do you do with the probabilities once you have them?” is perfectly accessible to us, even at this early stage, so let’s have some fun.",

    "text": "Task 6\nUp to now we’ve been worrying a lot about individual words, but individual words don’t create meaning. It’s how those words interact across phrases and sentences and paragraphs. Unfortunately, we do not have methods for inducing a probability distribution over the set of all possible sentences, or the set of all possible thoughts. But in a sense, language models are attempting to approximate such a thing. And on the evidence to date, maybe they succeed sometimes. Anyway, how do we go from a method that gets things right on the word level to a method that gets things right on the sentence level? Well, therein lies the art of the engineers that work on these things, and one method they have found helpful is called temperature sampling.\nSo far, given the current context, the model returns a (conditional) probability \\(p(i)\\) for each word \\(i\\in \\text{corpus}\\). So far we’ve used these probabilities unmodified. With temperature sampling, before we draw the next word, we first adjust the probabilities based on a user-defined tuning parameter \\(t&gt;0\\) called the temperature:\n\\[\np_t(i) = \\frac{p(i)^{1/t}}{\\sum\\limits_{j\\in\\text{corpus}}p(j)^{1/t}},\\quad i\\in\\text{corpus}.\n\\]\nIf \\(t=1\\), we’re back to the original probabilities: \\(p_1(i)=p(i)\\). Otherwise, to quote the \\(k\\)-grams people, “higher and lower temperatures make the original probability distribution smoother and rougher, respectively. By making a physical analogy, we can think of less probable words as states with higher energies, and the effect of higher (lower) temperatures is to make more (less) likely to excite these high energy states.” Why do people do this? To the best of my knowledge, it is no deeper than “it seems to work well.” In practice, adjusting the temperature seems to have a macro effect on the overall character of the sentences.\nThe function next_word_probs that we gave you has a fourth argument temp where you can give it a number and it will give you the tempered probabilities. Play around with big and small values, and report any effect that it has on the overall quality of the sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about it\n\n\n\nAs you increase the temperature and \\(t\\to\\infty\\), what does that do to the probabilities?",

    "text": "Let \\(X\\) be a random variable, let \\(g\\) be a transformation, and consider the new random variable \\(Y=g(X)\\). If all we cared about was the mean of \\(Y\\), then LOTUS provides a nice shortcut for computing \\(E(Y)=E[g(X)]\\) directly. But often, we want to know the entire distribution of the new random variable \\(Y\\), not just the mean. Today we will learn how to calculate it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe template\n\n\n\nIn all that follows, \\(X\\) is continuous with pdf \\(f_X\\) and cdf \\(F_X\\). The goal in each case is to compute the density \\(f_Y\\) of the new random variable \\(Y=g(X)\\). The process for doing this is always the same:\n\nPlot the transformation \\(g\\) so you understand what’s going on;\nFigure out what \\(\\text{Range}(Y)\\) is;\nFind the cdf of \\(Y\\): \\(F_Y(y)=P(Y\\leq y)\\);\nDifferentiate it to get the pdf: \\(f_Y(y)=F'_Y(y)\\).\n\nThis is the so-called “cdf method.”\n\n\nTask 1\nConsider \\(X\\sim \\text{Gamma}(1,\\,1)\\). This is the same as saying \\(X\\sim\\text{Exponential}(1)\\), which we saw in lecture on Monday.\n\nWhat are the range and pdf of \\(Y=\\ln X\\)?\nSimulate n = 5000 draws of \\(Y\\). Plot a histogram, and add a line plot of the density you derived in part b. They should match!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nTo begin, we know that \\(\\text{Range}(X)=[0,\\,\\infty)\\) and\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nF_X(x)&=1-e^{-x},&&x\\geq0\\\\\nf_X(x) &= e^{-x}, &&x\\geq0.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nOne of our math helpers displays the graph of the natural log and its inverse, the exponential. Consulting these, we note a few things:\n\nthe natural log takes in strictly positive numbers and spits out both positive and negative numbers;\nboth the natural log and the exponential are strictly increasing. In other words, they are order-preserving.\n\nThe first property implies that \\(\\text{Range}(Y)=\\mathbb{R}\\). So fix arbitrary \\(y\\in \\mathbb{R}\\). The cdf of \\(Y\\) is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nF_Y(y)&=P(Y\\leq y)\\\\\n&=P(\\ln X\\leq y)\\\\\n&=P(e^{\\ln X}\\leq e^y)\\\\\n&=P\\left(X\\leq e^y\\right)\\\\\n&=F_X\\left(e^y\\right)\\\\\n&=1-e^{-e^y}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSince the exponential function is order-preserving, we didn’t have to chage the inequality when we applied it to both sides. To get the pdf, take a derivative (using the chain rule!):\n\\[\nf_Y(y)=F_Y'(y)=\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d} y}\\left(1-e^{-e^y}\\right)=0-(-e^y)e^{-e^y}=e^{y-e^y},\\quad y\\in\\mathbb{R}.\n\\]\nIf we compare this density to the histogram from a simulation, they agree:\n\nset.seed(20)\nX &lt;- rgamma(5000, shape = 1, rate = 1)\nY &lt;- log(X)\nhist(Y, breaks = \"Scott\", freq = FALSE)\ncurve(exp(x - exp(x)), from = min(Y), to = max(Y), n = 1000, \n      col = \"red\", lwd = 3, add = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhew!\n\n\n\nTask 2\nConsider \\(X\\sim\\text{Unif}(-\\pi/2,\\,\\pi/2)\\).\n\nWhat are the range and pdf of \\(Y=\\tan X\\)?\nSimulate n = 5000 draws of \\(Y\\). Plot a histogram, and add a line plot of the density you derived in part b. Can you get them to match?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nBy construction, \\(\\text{Range}(X)=(-\\pi/2,\\,\\pi/2)\\). You can read more about the continuous uniform here, and we see see that the cdf is\n\\[\nF_X(x)\n=\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & x\\leq -\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\\\\n\\frac{x-\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)} & -\\frac{\\pi}{2}&lt;x&lt;\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\\\\n1 & \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\leq x.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nSo when \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}&lt;x&lt;\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), we have\n\\[\nF_X(x)=\\frac{x+\\frac{\\pi}{2}}{\\pi}=\\frac{x}{\\pi}+\\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]\nThe transformation is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, strictly-increasing, and it maps to all real numbers. So \\(\\text{Range}(Y)=\\mathbb{R}\\). Now let’s fix arbitrary \\(y\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) and find the cdf:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    F_Y(y)&=P(Y\\leq y)\\\\\n    &=P(\\tan X\\leq y)\\\\\n    &=P(X\\leq \\tan^{-1}y)\\\\\n    &=F_X(\\tan^{-1}y)\\\\\n    &=\\frac{\\tan^{-1}y}{\\pi}+\\frac{1}{2}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTake a derivative to get the pdf:\n\\[\nf_Y(y)\n=\nF'_Y(y)\n=\n\\frac{\\textrm{d}}{\\textrm{d}y}\n\\left(\n\\frac{\\tan^{-1}y}{\\pi}+\\frac{1}{2}\n\\right)\n=\n\\frac{1}{\\pi(1+y^2)},\\quad y\\in\\mathbb{R}.\n\\]\nRest assured that we did the math right, but you’d have a hard time verifying it with a simulation:\n\nset.seed(20)\nX &lt;- runif(5000, -pi / 2, pi / 2)\nY &lt;- tan(X)\nhist(Y, breaks = \"Scott\", freq = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the graph of the density we derived, and for reference I added the pdf of the standard normal distribution (bell curve):\n\nCodecurve(dnorm(x), from = -7, to = 7, n = 1000, ylab = \"\", bty = \"n\")\ncurve(dcauchy(x), from = -7, to = 7, n = 1000, add = TRUE, col = \"red\")\nlegend(\"topright\", c(\"N(0, 1) density\", \"Cauchy density\"), bty = \"n\",\n       lty = 1, col = c(\"black\", \"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to the bell curve, this new density has very heavy tails. They are so heavy in fact that this distribution does not have a finite mean or variance or any other moment. It is very ill-behaved, and it frequently surprises with extreme values far out in the tails. That’s why the histogram looks awful and always will.\nThis distribution we just derived is quite famous. It’s called the Cauchy distribution.\n\n\n\nTask 3\nConsider \\(X\\sim \\text{N}(0,\\,1)\\).\n\nWhat are the range and pdf of \\(Y=e^X\\)?\nSimulate n = 5000 draws of \\(Y\\). Plot a histogram, and add a line plot of the density you derived in part b. They should match!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know that \\(\\text{Range}(X)=\\mathbb{R}\\) and that\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_X(x)&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-x^2/2},&&x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\\\\nF_X(x)&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^xe^{-t^2/2}\\,\\text{d}t,&&x\\in\\mathbb{R}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNewsflash: the cdf of the normal distribution is unknown. We can approximate it arbitrarily well using numerical methods, but we don’t actually have a clean formula for it. The integral above is simply intractable.\nAnyway, the transformations involved here are again the exponential and the natural log, which we already saw in Task 1. Both are strictly-increasing. The exponential takes any real number and maps it to something strictly positive, so we see then that \\(\\text{Range}(Y)=(0,\\,\\infty)\\). Fixing \\(y&gt;0\\), we compute:\n\\[\n  \\begin{align*}\n      F_Y(y)&=P(Y\\leq y)\\\\\n      &=P(e^X\\leq y)\\\\\n      &=P\\left(X\\leq \\ln y\\right)\\\\\n      &=F_X\\left(\\ln y\\right).\n  \\end{align*}\n\\]\nAs such, the pdf is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_Y(y)\n=\nF'_Y(y)&=\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d} y}F_X(\\ln y)\\\\\n&=F_X'(\\ln y)\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}y}\\ln y\\\\\n&=f_X(\\ln y)\\frac{1}{y}\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-(\\ln y)^2/2}\\frac{1}{y},&&y&gt;0.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis matches with a simulation:\n\nset.seed(20)\nX &lt;- rnorm(5000)\nY &lt;- exp(X)\nhist(Y, breaks = \"Scott\", freq = FALSE)\ncurve(dnorm(log(x)) / x, from = min(Y), to = max(Y), n = 1000, \n      col = \"red\", lwd = 3, add = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution we derived here is an example of the log-normal distribution.\n\n\n\nInterlude\nGiven \\(X\\sim f_X\\), we want the density of \\(Y=g(X)\\). In the three examples, you followed the same basic steps:\n\nwrite the generic cdf of \\(Y\\): \\(F_Y(y)=P(Y\\leq y)=P(g(X)\\leq y)\\);\nrewrite the event inside until \\(X\\) is by itself (you probably have to undo or invert \\(g\\) to do this);\nsince \\(X\\) is by itself, rewrite the probability using the cdf of \\(X\\);\ndifferentiate (you probably have to use the chain rule to do this).\n\nThe basic template can be neatly summarized with the so-called change-of-variables formula, which tells you how to compute the density of \\(Y\\) using the density of \\(X\\) and the transformation \\(g\\):\n\\[\nf_Y(y)=f_X\\left(g^{-1}(y)\\right)\n    \\left|\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d} y}g^{-1}(y)\\right|,\\quad y\\in\\text{Range}(Y).\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\n\n\nAssume…\n\n\n\\(X\\) is absolutely continuous with pdf \\(f_X\\);\n\n\\(g\\) is defined for all \\(x\\in\\text{Range}(X)\\);\n\n\\(g\\) is differentiable and either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing (hence, invertible).\n\nThere are two cases:\n\n\nStrictly increasing\nIf \\(g\\) is strictly increasing, then \\(g^{-1}\\) is strictly increasing also. This means that \\(\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d} y}g^{-1}(y)\\) must be positive for all \\(y\\)! It also means that \\(g^{-1}\\) is order-preserving. If \\(a\\leq b\\), then \\(g^{-1}(a)\\leq g^{-1}(b)\\).\nFix arbitrary \\(y\\in\\text{Range}(Y)\\). Then:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    F_Y(y)\n    &=\n    P(Y\\leq y)\n    \\\\\n    &=\n    P\\left(g(X)\\leq y\\right)\n    \\\\\n    &=\n    P\\left(X\\leq g^{-1}(y)\\right)\n    \\\\\n    &=\n    F_X\\left(g^{-1}(y)\\right)\n    .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTaking a derivative and applying the chain rule gives\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    f_Y(y)\n    &=\n    \\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d} y}F_X\\left(g^{-1}(y)\\right)\n    \\\\\n    &=\n    f_X\\left(g^{-1}(y)\\right)\\underbrace{\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d} y}g^{-1}(y)}_{\\text{positive!}}\n    \\\\\n    &=\n    f_X\\left(g^{-1}(y)\\right)\n    \\left|\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d} y}g^{-1}(y)\\right|.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nStrictly decreasing\nIf \\(g\\) is strictly decreasing, then \\(g^{-1}\\) is strictly decreasing also.

Each blood test would cost one gold piece, but the Royal Purse only has 500 gold pieces to spare, and there are 1000 soldiers that need to be tested. Gandalf sleeps on it and returns the next day with a plan for testing all of them that won’t break the bank:\n\nTake a blood sample from each of the 1000 soldiers;\nSplit each of these samples into two parts;\nTake one part of each sample and mix batches of ten of the samples together to create 100 mixed samples.\nTest each of those mixed samples;\nA few things could happen:\n\nIf the test gives a negative result, we know all of the original ten samples are clear, and we can move on;\nIf the test gives a positive result, then we know at least one of the original ten samples is positive. In that case we test the second part of the sample for each of the ten soldiers. We can then identify which soldiers are positive.\n\n\nGandalf finishes by saying “I expect sixty of the mixed batches to be negative. For the other forty batches, I expect the results to be positive, and hence we will have to test all four hundred of the original samples. This gives a total expected cost of 500 gold pieces.”\n\nWhat disease prevalence is Gandalf implicitly assuming here?\nCan Gandalf revise his scheme to reduce the expected cost even more?"

    "text": "Not all election challenges are frivolous and cynical. Sometimes there are illegal/ineligible ballots in a close election, and if a candidate raises a legal challenge, a court must make a decision: certify the original results? adjust the vote totals somehow, possibly reversing the election? void the results entirely and order a new election? The concern of course is that the presence of the bad ballots might have swung the outcome, but how likely is this? Let’s model it.\nImagine an election where Angela Lansbury receives \\(a\\) votes, Bernadette Peters receives \\(b\\) votes, and Angela provisionally wins with a margin of victory \\(a-b&gt;0\\). However, of the total \\(a+b\\) votes, we learn that \\(k&gt;a-b\\) were invalid or illegal. But we know nothing else. We do not know who these folks are, where they came from, or who they voted for. We just know that they exist. If the \\(k\\) invalid ballots were removed from the total, what is the probability that it would flip the result of the election? If this probability is “too big,” we might start to worry.\nTo model this, think of the original \\(a+b\\) ballots as balls in the proverbial urn. \\(a\\) of these balls are red, and \\(b\\) of these balls are blue, and assume that \\(a,\\, b&gt;k\\). Removing the \\(k\\) invalid ballots is like drawing \\(k\\) balls out of the urn without replacement. Since we know nothing about the illegal ballots apart from the fact that they exist, assume that each of the \\(a+b\\) original ballots is equally likely to have been invalid. Next, imagine we randomly remove \\(k\\) balls from the urn, and let \\(X\\) be a random variable that counts the number of the removed/invalid ballots that belong to Angela. In other words, the number of red balls removed. If \\(X\\) is large enough, it will swing the election in Bernadette’s favor.\n\nWhat are the range and the pmf of the random variable \\(X\\)?\nFor what values of \\(X\\) does removing \\(k\\) ballots reverse the outcome of the election?\nBased on your answers to the previous parts, what is the probability that the election result is reversed when the \\(k\\) bad ballots are removed? Give a general formula for this probability, and then compute the probability for each of the real elections listed in Table 1;\nThe random variable \\(X\\) that you derived in the first part can be approximated by \\(\\text{Binom}(k,\\,1/2)\\). Explain why this approximation might be “good enough,” and verify that it’s not too bad by computing the approximate probability of reversal for the elections in Table 1. Compare the approximate probabilities to the actual ones from the previous part;\nLet’s say that we consider the probability of reversal “too big” if it is greater than 5%. Create a plot in R like Figure 1 with the following features:\n\nthe margin of victory \\(a-b\\) on the horizontal axis;\nthe number of bad ballots \\(k\\) on the vertical axis;\nscatterplot where each point represents an election in Table 1, with the points colored according to the decision that was made in the case;\ndivide the plane into two regions, one where the approximate probability of reversal is less than 0.05 and one where it is greater.\n\n\nWrite a few pithy paragraphs commenting on the following:\n\nthe assumptions of our lil’ model. Do you think they are innocuous? What might you change, and how?\nthe match or lack thereof between our model and the decisions that were actually made in the real cases;\nHow do you think a court should handle a legitimate election challenge? What are their responsibilities to the electorate, and what should they prioritize? Should they err on the side of upholding or voiding results? Should they think probabilistically?

Even so, because we have studied some basic probability theory, the mathematics of quantum mechanics is more accessible than you might guess. Behold:\n\n\nImagine a single particle at the (sub)atomic level1. A particle’s quantum state encodes information about all of its measurable properties, such as position, momentum, spin, and energy. In quantum mechanics, measuring these properties is fundamentally probabilistic. Before measurement, the particle doesn’t have a single, definite position or momentum; it has only probabilities for the possible outcomes. The quantum state of a particle is fully characterized by its wave function, and the squared magnitude of the wave function is a probability density that describes the distribution of the particle’s position, or momentum, or whatever else you wish to study. Let’s explore this in a very simple example.\nConsider a single, one-dimensional particle located somewhere in the interval \\([0,\\,L]\\). The wave function associated with the particle’s quantum state is\n\\[\n\\psi_n(x)\n=\n\\begin{cases}\nA\\cdot\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}x\\right) & 0\\leq x\\leq L\\\\\n0 & \\text{else},\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere \\(A\\geq 0\\) is the amplitude, and \\(n=1,\\,2,\\,3,\\,...\\) indexes the particle’s energy level. The higher the energy level, the more “excited” the particle is. Behold:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the particle does not have a definite position before measurement, we treat the position \\(X_n\\in[0,\\,L]\\) of the particle as a continuous random variable whose probability density function is \\(f_n(x)=|\\psi_n(x)|^2\\).\n\nCompute the value of \\(A\\) that ensures that \\(f_n\\) is a valid pdf;\nCompute the cdf of the random variable \\(X_n\\) and plot it for various values of \\(n\\);\nWhat is the expected location of the particle?\nWhat is the probability that the particle is located at the midpoint of the interval?\nLet \\(n=4\\) and \\(L=1\\). What is the probability that the particle is located in the interval \\([0.2, 0.3]\\)?\nThe parameter \\(n=1,\\,2,\\,3,\\,...\\) indexes the energy level of the particle. The larger the value of \\(n\\), the more excited the particle is. If \\(n\\to\\infty\\), then the particle is, like, super stoked.

    "text": "Problem 8\n\n\nAs you may have noticed, Spotify shuffle is not a perfectly random shuffle. If you have a playlist with \\(n\\) songs, Spotify’s shuffle algorithm definitely does not make all \\(n!\\) permutations equally likely. Why not? Because people don’t actually want that. Spotify used to implement a pure random shuffle, but users complained that it was too patternful. For better or worse, the human brain is wired to detect meaningless patterns in random noise. For instance, the picture on the left is a “truly” random scatter of points; the one on the right is manipulated so the points don’t “clump”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you survey people that don’t know any better, they often feel like the second picture is “more random” than the first because it lacks clumps, but this is a misunderstanding. A truly random playlist shuffle will often have clumps: clumps of artists, clumps of genres, etc. So when people say that they want “random,” what they really mean is just “variety” in some vague sense, and this is what Spotify shuffle tries to deliver. I could not find a good source for what Spotify shuffle currently does, but whatever it is, I personally dislike it.\n\nImagine your playlist of \\(n\\geq 3\\) unique tracks contains \\(2\\leq k\\leq \\lceil n/2\\rceil\\) songs by the same artist. What is the probability that a random permutation of the tracks will contain at least one streak of songs by that artist? A streak is two or more of their songs in a row;\n\nThis is the playlist I use when I grade exams (something I enjoy doing, btw). It contains \\(n = 14\\) songs. There are 11 artists with one song apiece1, and then Chaka Khan has \\(k=3\\) songs, because, why wouldn’t she? Shuffle this playlist at least twenty times2 and compute the proportion of the time the shuffle contained a “Chaka streak.” Using the previous part, compare this empirical proportion to the theoretical probability that would prevail if the shuffle was truly random.",

    "text": "In this class, we have to simplify many sums, infinite series, and integrals (eg when computing expected values). Sometimes, we have to do this using the formal techniques we learned in Calc II, but other times, the sum or integral is just a familiar object in disguise. If we can recognize that, we can avoid doing any hardcore math.\nHere’s the principle:\n\nTake your sum or integral and rewrite it (“massage” it) until you recognize (after “squinting” at it) that it is equivalent to a familiar object. Then plug in what you know.\n\nLet’s unpack that:\n\nmassaging: u-substitution if it’s an integral, re-indexing if it’s a sum, multiply by a cleverly written 1, add a cleverly written 0, complete the square, etc;\nfamiliar object: geometric series, Taylor series of a friendly function (probably \\(e^x\\)), gamma function, kernel of special density like the Gaussian, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay attention!\n\n\n\nIf you are going to be a stats major/minor, I know for an absolute fact that you will be doing this stuff early and often in STA 332 and STA 402, so take the practice seriously.\n\n\n\nKernel tricks\n\nProbability density functions must integrate to 1.\n\nLike “energy is conserved” or “demand curves slope down,” the above statement is true and simple, but surprisingly powerful.\nAs we have seen several times, all densities have the following format:\n\\[\nf(x;\\,\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\underbrace{c(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})}_{\\text{normalizing constant}}\\underbrace{k(x;\\,\\boldsymbol{\\theta})}_{\\text{kernel}}.\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) is generic notation for the parameters of the distribution. So \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=(\\mu,\\, \\sigma^2)\\) for the normal, or \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=(\\alpha,\\,\\beta)\\) for the gamma. \\(k(x;\\,\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\) is the density kernel or unnormalized density. It’s the part of the density formula that actually depends on the argument \\(x\\). \\(c(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\) is the normalizing constant that hangs out in the front and serves just to make sure that the whole thing integrates to 1. Since\n\\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x;\\,\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\,\\text{d} x\n=\n\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty c(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})k(x;\\,\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\,\\text{d} x\n=\nc(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty k(x;\\,\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\,\\text{d} x=1,\n\\]\nthen\n\\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty k(x;\\,\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\,\\text{d} x=\\frac{1}{c(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})},\n\\]\nSo, the integral of the kernel is the inverse of the normalizing constant. Based on this simple fact, every probability density function you encounter gives you a free integral identity that you can use in subsequent computations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Gaussian integral\n\n\n\nFor the Gaussian density:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n    c(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\n    &=\n    \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\n    \\\\\n    k(x;\\,\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\n    &=\n    \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right)\n    .\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nSo for any values of \\(\\mu\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\\sigma&gt;0\\), we get\n\\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right)\\text{d} x=\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}.\n\\]\nUse this fact to make your life easier!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: gamma integral\n\n\n\nFor the gamma density:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n    c(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\n    &=\n    \\frac{\\beta^\\alpha}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)}\n    \\\\\n    k(x;\\,\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\n    &=\n    x^{\\alpha-1}\n    e^{-\\beta x}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nSo for any values of \\(\\alpha,\\,\\beta&gt;0\\), we get\n\\[\n\\int_0^\\infty x^{\\alpha-1}e^{-\\beta x}\\,\\text{d} x=\\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha)}{\\beta^\\alpha}\n\\]\nUse this fact to make your life easier!\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n“Massage and squint” is just a grand exercise in pattern recognition, so here is a running list of examples from the course.

The derivatives contain information about the shape of the original function:\n\nthe first derivative tells you if the function is increasing or decreasing;\n\nif \\(f'(x)&gt;0\\), then \\(f\\) is increasing at \\(x\\);\nif \\(f'(x)&lt;0\\), then \\(f\\) is decreasing at \\(x\\);\nif \\(f'(x)=0\\), then \\(f\\) is not changing at \\(x\\);\n\n\nif the second derivative tells you about the curvature (aka concavity) of the function:\n\nif \\(f''(x)&gt;0\\), then \\(f\\) is concave up (\\(\\cup\\), smiling) at \\(x\\);\nif \\(f''(x)&lt;0\\), then \\(f\\) is concave down (\\(\\cap\\), frowning) at \\(x\\).\n\n\n\nHere is an illustration with the function \\(f(x)=x^3-x\\) and its derivatives \\(f'(x)=3x^2-1\\) and \\(f''(x)=6x\\) (power rule!):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\nWhen the first derivative changes sign (at \\(x^\\star=\\pm1/\\sqrt{3}\\)), that corresponds to the original function switching from increasing to decreasing, or vice versa.

A point like \\(x=0\\) in this example where the concavity changes is called an inflection point. If \\(x_0\\) is an inflection point, then that means it’s also a root of the second derivative: \\(f''(x_0)=0\\). In order for the second derivative to change sign, it has to cross the \\(x\\)-axis.\nHowever, just because the second derivative is zero doesn’t mean there was inflection.

It’s just swooping down and giving it a gentle lil’ smooch from above. Correspondingly, we see that the original function never changes concavity. Therefore, we say that \\(f''=0\\) is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the original \\(f\\) to change concavity. To verify, you must actually check that the second derivative has different sign before and after the root. Bummer!",

Here’s an illustration:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInspecting this picture, we notice that the maximum corresponds to a point where the derivative (slope of the tangent line) is zero. In order for the function to “top out,” it must at some point have switched from being increasing (positive derivative) to decreasing (negative derivative).
