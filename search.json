    "text": "Functions in R are often vectorized. For example:\n\nexp(2)\n\n[1] 7.389056\n\n\nI give it one number, and it returns one number. If instead, I supply a vector, I get this:\n\nexp(c(-3, 0.001, 2, 5, 600, 1, 0))\n\n[1]  4.978707e-02  1.001001e+00  7.389056e+00  1.484132e+02 3.773020e+260\n[6]  2.718282e+00  1.000000e+00\n\n\nSo when I supply a regular ol’ number as an argument, the exp function returns a number. When I supply a vector, it returns a vector; the exp function knows to act entry-wise and give me back a vector with the output of each entry-wise computation. In other words, I didn’t have to write a loop to manually do this. The function is vectorized, so it effectively runs the loop for me.\nSo consider for instance the set of numbers \\(A = \\{-100, -6, 0.001, \\pi, 30\\}\\), and this stupid function:\n\\[\nf(x) = \\ln^2\\left|\\frac{2x}{1-\\sin(x)}\\right|.\n\\]\nIf I wanted to compute the value of \\(f\\) for each of the arguments in \\(A\\), I could write a loop that goes entry-by-entry through \\(A\\) and applies the function \\(f\\) to it. But in R, because arithmetic operations are vectorized, I can do this:\n\nA = c(-100, -6, 0.001, pi, 30)\n\nlog( abs( (2 * A) / ( 1 - sin(A) ) ) ) ^ 2 \n\n[1] 36.051349  7.910714 38.608919  3.377792 11.609009\n\n\nDumb!\nAll of the basic arithmetic operations are vectorized like this:\n\nc(1, 2, 3) + 2\n\n[1] 3 4 5\n\n\n\nc(1, 2, 3) + c(1, 2, 3)\n\n[1] 2 4 6\n\n\n\nfloor(c(4, 5.1, 6.9))\n\n[1] 4 5 6",

The “c” stands for “concatenate.” You’re concatenating, or joining, the vectors end-to-end:\n\nmore &lt;- c(\"whose\", \"chain\", \"was\", \"red\", \"as\")\n\nmasterpiece &lt;- c(poetry, more)\nmasterpiece\n\n [1] \"Mary\"     \"had\"      \"a\"        \"little\"   \"chainsaw\" \"whose\"   \n [7] \"chain\"    \"was\"      \"red\"      \"as\"",

If you get one, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the limit does not exist. It just means that the jury is still out; it’s indeterminate. To continue investigating, you can use a tool called L’Hôpital’s rule. Whenever \\(\\lim_{x\\to c}f(x)=\\lim_{x\\to c}g(x)=0\\) or \\(\\pm\\infty\\), the rule says that\n\\[\n\\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}.\n\\] The hope is that the new function \\(f'(x)/g'(x)\\) will be well-behaved at \\(c\\), meaning you can simplify by just plugging in. However, after applying L’Hôpital’s rule once and trying to plug-in, you may still get an indeterminate form.

Spotify used to implement a pure random shuffle, but users complained that it was too patternful. For better or worse, the human brain is wired to detect meaningless patterns in random noise. For instance, the picture on the left is a “truly” random scatter of points; the one on the right is manipulated so the points don’t “clump”:\nWhen you survey people that don’t know any better, they often feel like the second picture is “more random” than the first because it lacks clumps, but this is a misunderstanding. A truly random playlist shuffle will often have clumps: clumps of artists, clumps of genres, etc. So when people say that they want “random,” what they really mean is just “variety” in some vague sense, and this is what Spotify shuffle tries to deliver.

In that case we test the second part of the sample for each of the ten soldiers. We can then identify which soldiers are positive.\n\n\nGandalf finishes by saying “I expect sixty of the mixed batches to be negative.

    "text": "Not all election challenges are frivolous and cynical. Sometimes there are illegal/ineligible ballots in a close election, and if a candidate raises a legal challenge, a court must make a decision: certify the original results? adjust the vote totals somehow, possibly reversing the election? void the results entirely and order a new election? The concern of course is that the presence of the bad ballots might have swung the outcome, but how likely is this? Let’s model it.\nImagine an election where Angela Lansbury receives \\(a\\) votes, Bernadette Peters receives \\(b\\) votes, and Angela provisionally wins with a margin of victory \\(a-b&gt;0\\). However, of the total \\(a+b\\) votes, we learn that \\(k&gt;a-b\\) were invalid or illegal. But we know nothing else. We do not know who these folks are, where they came from, or who they voted for. We just know that they exist. If the \\(k\\) invalid ballots were removed from the total, what is the probability that it would flip the result of the election? If this probability is “too big,” we might start to worry.\nTo model this, think of the original \\(a+b\\) ballots as balls in the proverbial urn. \\(a\\) of these balls are red, and \\(b\\) of these balls are blue, and assume that \\(a,\\, b&gt;k\\). Removing the \\(k\\) invalid ballots is like drawing \\(k\\) balls out of the urn without replacement. Since we know nothing about the illegal ballots apart from the fact that they exist, assume that each of the \\(a+b\\) original ballots is equally likely to have been invalid. Next, imagine we randomly remove \\(k\\) balls from the urn, and let \\(X\\) be a random variable that counts the number of the removed/invalid ballots that belong to Angela. In other words, the number of red balls removed. If \\(X\\) is large enough, it will swing the election in Bernadette’s favor.\n\nWhat are the range and the pmf of the random variable \\(X\\)?\nFor what values of \\(X\\) does removing \\(k\\) ballots reverse the outcome of the election?\nBased on your answers to the previous parts, what is the probability that the election result is reversed when the \\(k\\) bad ballots are removed? Give a general formula for this probability, and then compute the probability for each of the real elections listed in Table 1;\nThe random variable \\(X\\) that you derived in the first part can be approximated by \\(\\text{Binom}(k,\\,1/2)\\). Explain why this approximation might be “good enough,” and verify that it’s not too bad by computing the approximate probability of reversal for the elections in Table 1. Compare the approximate probabilities to the actual ones from the previous part;\nLet’s say that we consider the probability of reversal “too big” if it is greater than 5%. Create a figure in R with the following features:\n\nthe margin of victory \\(a-b\\) on the horizontal axis;\nthe number of bad ballots \\(k\\) on the vertical axis;\nscatterplot where each point represents an election in Table 1, with the points colored according to the decision that was made in the case;\ndivide the plane into two regions, one where the approximate probability of reversal is less than 0.05 and one where it is greater.\n\nWrite a few pithy paragraphs commenting on the following:\n\nthe assumptions of our lil’ model. Do you think they are innocuous? What might you change, and how?\nthe match or lack thereof between our model and the decisions that were actually made in the real cases;\nHow do you think a court should handle a legitimate election challenge?

    "text": "Quantum mechanics has a reputation for being an intimidating branch of theoretical physics, and JZ certainly doesn’t understand a ding dong thing about it. Even so, because we have studied some basic probability theory, the mathematics of quantum mechanics is more accessible than you might guess. Behold:\nImagine a single particle at the (sub)atomic level1. A particle’s quantum state encodes information about all of its measurable properties, such as position, momentum, spin, and energy. In quantum mechanics, measuring these properties is fundamentally probabilistic. Before measurement, the particle doesn’t have a single, definite position or momentum; it has only probabilities for the possible outcomes. The quantum state of a particle is fully characterized by its wave function, and the squared magnitude of the wave function is a probability density that describes the distribution of the particle’s position, or momentum, or whatever else you wish to study. Let’s explore this in a very simple example.\nConsider a single, one-dimensional particle located somewhere in the interval \\([0,\\,L]\\). The wave function associated with the particle’s quantum state is\n\\[\n\\psi_n(x)\n=\n\\begin{cases}\nA\\cdot\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}x\\right) & 0\\leq x\\leq L\\\\\n0 & \\text{else},\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere \\(A\\geq 0\\) is the amplitude, and \\(n=1,\\,2,\\,3,\\,...\\) indexes the particle’s energy level. The higher the energy level, the more “excited” the particle is. Behold:\nBecause the particle does not have a definite position before measurement, we treat the position \\(X_n\\in[0,\\,L]\\) of the particle as a continuous random variable whose probability density function is \\(f_n(x)=|\\psi_n(x)|^2\\)."

The derivatives contain information about the shape of the original function:\n\nthe first derivative tells you if the function is increasing or decreasing;\n\nif \\(f'(x)&gt;0\\), then \\(f\\) is increasing at \\(x\\);\nif \\(f'(x)&lt;0\\), then \\(f\\) is decreasing at \\(x\\);\nif \\(f'(x)=0\\), then \\(f\\) is not changing at \\(x\\);\n\n\nif the second derivative tells you about the curvature (aka concavity) of the function:\n\nif \\(f''(x)&gt;0\\), then \\(f\\) is concave up (\\(\\cup\\), smiling) at \\(x\\);\nif \\(f''(x)&lt;0\\), then \\(f\\) is concave down (\\(\\cap\\), frowning) at \\(x\\).\n\n\n\nHere is an illustration with the function \\(f(x)=x^3-x\\) and its derivatives \\(f'(x)=3x^2-1\\) and \\(f''(x)=6x\\) (power rule!):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\nWhen the first derivative changes sign (at \\(x^\\star=\\pm1/\\sqrt{3}\\)), that corresponds to the original function switching from increasing to decreasing, or vice versa. When the second derivative changes sign (at \\(x_0=0\\)), that corresponds to the original function switching from concave down (frowning) to concave up (smiling). A point like \\(x=0\\) in this example where the concavity changes is called an inflection point. If \\(x_0\\) is an inflection point, then that means it’s also a root of the second derivative: \\(f''(x_0)=0\\). In order for the second derivative to change sign, it has to cross the \\(x\\)-axis.\nHowever, just because the second derivative is zero doesn’t mean there was inflection. Consider \\(f(x)=x^4\\) and its derivatives \\(f'(x)=4x^3\\) and \\(f''(x)=12x^2\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, we see that while the second derivative has a root at zero, it doesn’t actually cross the \\(x\\)-axis. It’s just swooping down and giving it a gentle lil’ smooch from above. Correspondingly, we see that the original function never changes concavity. Therefore, we say that \\(f''=0\\) is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the original \\(f\\) to change concavity. To verify, you must actually check that the second derivative has different sign before and after the root. Bummer!",

    "text": "Optimization\nDifferentiation is useful when we seek to optimize a function. That is, find where it has local maxima or minima. For purposes of illustration, I’ll focus on maxima. Formally, given an objective function \\(f\\), we seek to find the \\(x\\)-values at which \\(f\\) has a maximum:\n\\[\n\\underset{x\\in\\mathbb{R}}{\\arg\\max}\\,f(x).\n\\]\nNotice that I did not write \\(\\max f(x)\\). In this class, it turns out that we will seldom care about the actual largest value that the function obtains. Instead, we care only for where that value occurs. So we are interested in the maximizer; the location of the maximum; the \\(x\\)-value that does the maximizing. Hence, argmax and not max. Here’s an illustration:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInspecting this picture, we notice that the maximum corresponds to a point where the derivative (slope of the tangent line) is zero. In order for the function to “top out,” it must at some point have switched from being increasing (positive derivative) to decreasing (negative derivative). When we ask where the maximum occurs, that’s the same as asking where the first derivative switched sign (ie crossed the \\(x\\)-axis). So to optimize \\(f\\), perhaps we can compute its first derivative, set it equal to 0, and solve.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nf'(x)\n=\n-2x+6&=0\n\\quad\n\\implies\n\\quad\nx^\\star=3.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nA point like \\(x^\\star\\) in this example is called a critical point. A critical point may be the location of a maximum, but you have to check. If you recall the example in Figure 1, there are two critical points \\(x^\\star = \\pm 1/\\sqrt{3}\\), but they correspond to different things: one is a minimum and one is a maximum. In order to classify the critical points as maximizers or minimizers, you perform the second derivative test:\n\nif \\(f'(x^\\star)=0\\) and \\(f''(x^\\star)&lt;0\\), then \\(x^\\star\\) is a maximizer;\nif \\(f'(x^\\star)=0\\) and \\(f''(x^\\star)&gt;0\\), then \\(x^\\star\\) is a minimizer;\nif \\(f'(x^\\star)=0\\) and \\(f''(x^\\star)=0\\), then the test is inconclusive.",
