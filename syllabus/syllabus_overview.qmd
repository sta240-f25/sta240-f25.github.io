## Description

In **probability**, we describe the distribution of a random phenomenon and then study how the realizations of that phenomenon typically behave. In **statistics**, we do the reverse; we start with the realizations of a random phenomenon, and then try to figure out what distribution generated them. We will spend twelve weeks on the first, and then three weeks on the second.

**Prerequisites:** single-variable calculus.
