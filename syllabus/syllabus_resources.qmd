## Course costs

If you are having difficulty with the costs associated with this course (obtaining a laptop, mostly), here are some resources:

-   [**Karsh Office of Undergraduate Support**](https://financialaid.duke.edu/)**:** Regardless of your aid package, Karsh offers loans and resources for connecting students with campus programs that might help alleviate course costs.

-   [**DukeLIFE**](https://dukelife.duke.edu/programs/course-materials-assistance/)**:** The Course Material Assistance program offers assistance for eligible students, including through the [LIFE Loaner Laptop Program](https://dukelife.duke.edu/academic-support/loaner-laptop-program/). Students who are eligible for DukeLIFE benefits are notified before the start of the semester; program resources are limited.

## Tech support

Contact the Duke OIT Service Desk at [oit.duke.edu/help](https://oit.duke.edu/help).

## Academic support

There are times you may need help with the class that is beyond what can be provided by the teaching team. In those instances, I encourage you to visit the Academic Resource Center. The [Academic Resource Center (the ARC)](https://arc.duke.edu) offers services to support students academically during their undergraduate careers at Duke. The ARC can provide support with time management, academic skills and strategies, course-specific tutoring, and more. ARC services are available free to all Duke undergraduate student studying any discipline.

You can contact the Academic Resource Center by phone at (919) 684-5917, by email at `theARC@duke.edu`, or by visiting <http://arc.duke.edu/>.

## Accessibility

If any portion of the course is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.

The [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure that students can engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should contact the SDAO to [request or update accommodations](https://access.duke.edu/requests) under these circumstances.
